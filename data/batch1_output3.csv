朱元璋,yes,Zhu Yuanzhang,"Zhu Yuanzhang, also known as the Hongwu Emperor, was the founder and first emperor of the Ming Dynasty in China, reigning from 1368 to 1398.",https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9C%B1%E5%85%83%E7%92%8B,明太祖朱元璋（1328年10月21日—1398年6月24日），原名朱重八，曾改名朱興宗，字国瑞，濠州钟离县（今安徽省凤阳县）人，中国明朝開國皇帝，于公元1368年建立明朝，在位三十一年，年号“洪武”，廟號「太祖」，谥號「开天行道肇纪立极大圣至神仁文义武俊德成功高皇帝」，統稱「太祖高皇帝」。 幼时贫穷，曾为地主放牛。後因災變，曾一度剃髮出家，四处流浪，化緣為生。25岁（1352年）时，参加郭子兴领导的红巾军反抗元朝政权，並受郭子興取名元璋。先後击败了陈友谅、张士诚等其他諸侯軍閥，统一南方。後北伐推翻了元朝统治，建立了新的大一統皇朝政權，国号“大明”。 建国之后，朱元璋下令农民归耕，奖励垦荒；大興移民屯田和军屯；组织各地农民兴修水利；大力提倡种植桑、麻、棉等经济作物和果木作物；下令解放奴婢；减免賦稅。派人到全国各地丈量土地，清查户口等等。经过洪武时期的努力，社会生产逐渐恢复和发展，史称「洪武之治」。同时立《大明律》，用严刑峻法管理百姓与官僚，禁止百姓未经许可自由迁徙，并极为严厉地惩治官吏的贪污腐败。朱元璋还设立了锦衣卫等特务机构，整肅他認為威脅其朝廷之顯貴勢力，在胡、藍等案中大殺開國功臣，並废中书省，由皇帝直領各部，进一步加强了君主專制。 朱元璋生活儉樸、工作勤奮，在今南京的皇宮內，沒有設立“御花園”，只有“御菜園”，其中種滿蔬菜，使得皇宮自給自足。大封宗籓，令世世皆食歲祿，不授職任事。洪武元年令：「凡孝子順孫、義夫節婦、志行卓異者，有司正官舉名，監察御史、按察司體覆，轉達上司，旌表門閭。又令：民間寡婦，三十以前，夫亡守制，五十以後，不改節者，旌表門閭（貞節牌坊），除免本家差役。」洪武二十六年令：「凡婦人因夫、子得封者，不許再嫁。如不遵守，將所授誥赦追奪，斷罪離異。其有追奪為事官誥赦，具本奏繳內府，會同吏科給事中、中書舍人，於勘合低簿內，附寫為事緣由，眼同燒毀。」使明朝婦女守寡盛行。此外，亦創立明朝入宮婦女的生殉制度。1398年，朱元璋驾崩于南京，後传位于嫡长孙朱允炆，即明惠帝。 元文宗天曆元年九月十八日（1328年10月29日）未時，朱元璋出生於濠州钟离县东乡（今安徽省凤阳县小溪河镇燃灯寺村），排行第三。朱元璋先世家沛（今江苏沛县），後徙句容（今江苏省句容市）达百年之久。祖辈生活在古泗州（今江苏省盱眙县）。父親朱五四（後改為世珍），母親陳氏為泗州盱眙人、或濠州钟离县（今安徽省凤阳县）人。朱元璋出身贫农家庭，出生地之争由来已久，有明光说（也就是盱眙说、嘉山说）、凤阳说（也就是钟离说）、句容说、五河说、沛县说、宿州说等。后四说基本上没有证据支持，经不住推敲，明显不能成立。争议主要出现在明光和凤阳之间（均位於今安徽省東部）。 朱元璋幼時甚貧困，並無法讀書，曾為地主放牛。牧童伙伴多人都奉朱为领袖，且日后成朱起义将领多人，至正四年四月（1344年）淮北大旱，引發饑荒，初六朱元璋父親去世，初九兄長去世，廿二日母親去世，朱元璋與仲兄埋葬家人後於秋九月入皇覺寺當行童。入寺五十日，因荒年寺租難收，寺主封倉遣散眾僧，朱元璋只得離鄉為遊方僧雲遊淮西潁州。 元至正八年（1348年），朱元璋游歷淮西、汝潁、泗等州完畢，返回皇覺寺并逐渐讀書识字。至正十二年（1352年）二月辛丑，身在皇覺寺多年的朱元璋受好友湯和來信勸說，到濠州投靠郭子興，參加紅巾軍。由於指揮有方，不久便成為郭子興身旁一名親兵并赐名元璋字国瑞，並娶郭子興養女马氏（即後來的孝慈高皇后马氏）。後來朱元璋見郭子興與其他濠州紅巾軍領袖如孫德崖、趙均用不和，屢有衝突，朱元璋不願涉及濠州內鬥，故主動要求返家鄉招募新兵，徐達、湯和等朱元璋兒時好友獲准隨行，不久朱元璋的部隊已有結集了數千人。次年，朱元璋部隊攻下滁州，成為他首個據點，同時也在攻佔滁州期間，李善長加入朱元璋部隊，成為他一個重要幕僚。此時，濠州的郭子興被孫德崖及趙均用迫走，前來滁州投靠朱元璋，由於朱元璋名義上仍是郭子興部下，朱元璋乃將滁州兵權交予郭子興。 至正十四年（1354年），張士誠據高郵，自稱“誠王”；十五年，元朝丞相脫脫率軍進攻高郵，分兵攻六合，六合乃滁州屏障，故朱元璋領兵援六合，幸好脫脫被誣陷而被迫交出兵權，元軍不戰自潰，滁州也轉危為安。朱元璋見滁州地小，建議進攻長江北岸的和州。朱元璋攻下和州不久，郭子興病故，郭子興次子郭天敘被立為都元帥，朱元璋與郭子興妻弟張天祐為副元帥，遥奉韩林儿的大宋龙凤政权。同年夏，常遇春、廖永安、俞通海歸附朱元璋，使得其軍著手渡江攻入采石、太平路，並計劃攻取集庆路（今南京市）。此時，元軍降將陳野先願協助紅巾軍攻集慶，郭天敘與張天祐感軍功不及朱元璋，故決定在陳野先引領下，親自領軍攻打集慶。結果紅巾軍攻集慶時陳野先叛變，郭、張二人被殺，陳野先也死於亂軍中。郭天敘與張天祐死後，朱元璋成為都元帥，盡領郭子興舊部。至正十六年（1356年），朱元璋領軍再攻集慶，一舉攻陷，改名應天府，作為根據地。至此，朱元璋以應天府為中心，與元朝軍隊、張士誠、徐壽輝等部形成犬牙交錯之勢。 朱元璋攻佔應天後，開始攻佔應天周邊地區以鞏固防務。至正十六年，遣徐達攻佔鎮江、鄧愈克廣德，次年，遣耿炳文克長興，徐達克常州，而朱元璋親自率眾攻取寧國。隨後趙繼祖克江陰、徐達克常熟。胡大海克徽州、常遇春克池州，繆大亨克揚州。至正十八年，朱元璋親取婺州。明年，朱元璋陸續攻佔浙東餘下各地，常遇春克衢州、胡大海克處州，至此朱元璋部控制江左、浙右各地，向西與陳友諒部相鄰。朱元璋攻下浙東後，小明王升朱元璋為儀同三司江南等處行中書省左丞相，同時朱元璋也得浙東名士如朱升、劉基相助，朱元璋採取朱升「高築牆、廣積糧、緩稱王」的建議，採取穩健的進攻措施；並且遵照劉基「先漢(陳友諒)後周(張士誠)」之策略，着手對江南各勢力進行對抗。 至正二十年，陳友諒攻陷太平路，隨後弒主徐壽輝、稱帝建國，國號漢，之後傾全軍攻應天府。朱元璋與劉基設計，先命胡大海進攻信州，斷陳友諒後援，再命部下康茂才詐降作陳友諒的內應，引漢軍主力進入朱元璋在應天城外龍灣設下的埋伏中，結果漢軍被朱元璋軍隊大敗，隨後朱元璋攻取太平、安慶、信州等地。。至正二十一年，朱元璋改樞密院為大都督府，重新整理軍制。北結察罕帖木兒、密通方國珍，而與正面的陳友諒部進行會戰。同年攻克江州、南康、建昌、撫州等地。次年，佔領龍興，改洪都府（今江西南昌）。 至正二十三年（1363年），张士诚派部将吕珍围攻退守安丰的小明王韓林兒及丞相劉福通，朱元璋不顧劉基反對，派軍北上解安豐之圍，結果刘福通战死，韩林儿被朱元璋救出。此后，韩林儿被朱元璋安置在滁州，仍然被奉为皇帝。陳友諒趁朱元璋主力軍北上，率六十萬水軍進攻朱元璋根據地，首先圍攻洪都，但朱元璋姪朱文正堅守洪都兩個多月，待朱元璋親率二十萬部隊馳援，陳友諒大軍改往鄱陽湖與朱元璋大軍交戰，史稱“鄱陽湖之戰”。陳友諒自恃巨艦出戰，採用炮攻，朱元璋險些負傷被擒。隨後，朱元璋利用東北風而改用火攻，致使陳友諒部大量受損。之後朱元璋利用鄱陽湖水位降低便於小舟活動，改為分兵水路圍攻陳友諒。陳友諒中箭身亡，漢軍潰敗。隨後朱元璋圍攻武昌，并盡佔湖北各地。次年，朱元璋自立為「吳王」，以李善長為右相國，徐達為左相國，常遇春、俞通海為平章政事，立子朱標為世子。次月再次親征武昌，陳友諒之子陳理舉降。隨後吳軍相繼攻克廬州、吉安、衡州。至正二十五年，吳軍繼續攻佔寶慶、贛州、浦城、襄陽，同年冬，下令討張士誠。次年，吳軍再次攻破湖州、杭州。再一年，徐達克平江，張士誠被俘，至此朱元璋一統江南。至正二十六年（1366年），朱元璋派廖永忠迎接韩林儿至應天府，途中在瓜步渡长江时，韩林儿所乘船只沉没，韩林儿遇难。 吴元年（1367年），朱元璋命湯和為征南將軍，討伐割據浙東多年的方國珍。隨後制定北伐战略：先攻取山東，其次進攻河南，再次攻佔陝西潼关，最後再進軍元大都。隨後命徐達為征虜大將軍，常遇春為副將軍，帥師二十五萬，由淮河進入，北取中原。并命胡廷瑞為征南將軍，何文輝為副將軍，進攻福建。同年，方國珍投降，徐達攻破山東濟南，胡廷瑞下邵武，湯和、廖永忠由海道攻克福建福州。北伐一直持續到洪武年間，徐達、常遇春隨後攻佔整個河南、山西，最終直取元大都（今北京）。 吴二年正月初四（1368年1月23日），朱元璋在應天府（今南京市）登基即位稱帝，定國號為大明，年號洪武，是為「明太祖」，以應天為「南京」，開封為「北京」，明王朝宣告建立。同年八月初二（1368年9月14日），大將徐達攻克元大都（今北京市），元順帝北遁，元朝覆亡，明朝正式成為中國的統治政權，朱元璋也隨之成為全中國皇帝。由于幼年对于元末吏治痛苦记忆，即位后一方面減輕農民負擔，恢復社會的經濟生產，改革元朝留下的糟糕吏治，懲治貪污的官吏，社會經濟得到恢復和發展，史稱洪武之治。明太祖確立了里甲制，配合賦役黃冊戶籍登記簿冊和魚鱗圖冊的施行，落實賦稅勞役的徵收及地方治安的維持。 平定天下後，朱元璋大封諸將為公侯，部份追封為王。初封六公，其中以五大將、一大臣為開國元勳。分別為：韓國公李善長、魏國公徐達、鄭國公常遇春、曹國公李文忠、宋國公馮勝、衛國公鄧愈。而後又追封胡大海為越国公、戰死的丁德興為濟國公，湯和為信國公、馮國用封郢國公。次年，明太祖於雞鳴山立功臣廟，六月初三日廟成，太祖親定功臣位次，以徐達為首，次常遇春、李文忠、鄧愈、湯和、沐英、胡大海、馮國用、趙德勝、耿再成、華高、丁德興、俞通海、張德勝、吳良、吳禎、曹良臣、康茂才、吳復、茅成、孫興祖凡二十一人。死者像祀，生者虛位。又以廖永安、俞通海、張德勝、桑世杰、耿再成、胡大海、丁德興七人配享太廟。此位序屡经删汰，已非洪武二年所定名单位次。 随後，朱元璋进一步加强中央集权。洪武三年（1370年），杀中书左丞杨宪。洪武四年七月十一（1371年8月21日），傅友德攻克成都，明朝平定四川。洪武五年四月二十三日（1372年5月26日），廖永忠率明军平定广西，洪武五年六月初三（1372年7月3日），傅友德大败元军，明朝平定甘肃。洪武六年（1373年），太祖鑒於開國元勛多倚功犯法，虐暴鄉閭，特命工部制造鐵榜，鑄上申戒公侯的條令，類似戰國時代的「鑄刑鼎」。洪武八年（1375年），德庆侯廖永忠因僭用龙凤诸不法事，赐死。洪武十二年（1379年），贬右丞相汪广洋于广南，旋赐死。洪武十三年（1380年），胡惟庸案发，左丞相胡惟庸被诛，太祖罢中书省，分中书省之权归于六部，直接归皇帝掌管。洪武十五年（1382年），设立锦衣卫，加强明朝特务统治。1382年1月6日，明军在云南昆明附近大败元朝军队，元梁王自杀，1382年4月7日，蓝玉、沐英攻克大理，段氏投降，明朝平定雲南。洪武十八年（1385年），郭桓案发，由于涉案人员甚多，太祖將六部左右侍郎以下官员皆處死，各省官吏死於獄中達數萬人以上。 洪武二十三年（1390年），李善長的家奴盧仲謙告發李善長與胡惟庸往來勾結，以「狐疑觀望懷兩端，大逆不道」見誅，接續又誅殺陸仲亨與唐勝宗、費聚、趙庸三名侯爵，株連被殺的功臣及其家屬共計達三萬餘人，連「浙東四先生」（刘基、宋濂、章溢、叶琛）亦不能免，并頒布《昭示奸黨錄》。洪武二十六年（1393年），藍玉被錦衣衛指揮蔣瓛密告謀反，史称“藍玉案”。此案牵连到十三侯、二伯，連坐族誅達一萬五千人，明朝建国功臣因此案幾乎全亡。此時太祖又頒布《逆臣錄》，詔示一公、十三侯、二伯。洪武二十七年（1394年），太祖杀江夏侯周德兴以及颖国公傅友德，在捕鱼儿海战役中立功的定远侯王弼亦被赐死。洪武二十八年（1395年），开国六公爵最後一位僅存者冯胜被杀。 在处理内政同时，太祖亦多次籌劃北伐蒙古以保障北方邊塞的安寧，大勝。並曾成功在甘肅擊敗王保保（1372年）、在东北逼降納哈出（1387年）、在蒙古高原大破元末主脫古思帖木兒致其被也速迭儿杀死（1388年），北元灭亡。同时太祖进军辽东，使朝鮮王朝等归顺（1388年）。 洪武三十一年閏五月初十日（1398年6月24日），朱元璋崩於南京皇宮內，享壽七十歲，在位三十一年，與已故的元配妻子孝慈高皇后馬氏一起長眠於南京紫金山明孝陵。《明朝小史·卷三》載，責殉諸妃，強迫伺寝宫人尽数殉葬。《彤史拾遺記》記載，太祖以四十六妃陪葬孝陵，其中所殉，惟宮人十數人。公佈遺詔： 五月朱元璋病少間，已經召诸医官治疾无状者尽付狱。新任皇帝惠宗即遵照遺命盡殺戴思恭以外其他御醫。 洪武三十一年六月甲辰，上謚曰“欽明啟運俊德成功統天大孝高皇帝”，廟號太祖。永樂元年六月十一日丁巳，增諡“聖神文武欽明啟運俊德成功統天大孝高皇帝”。 嘉靖十七年十一月朔，改諡“開天行道肇紀立極大聖至神仁文義武俊德成功高皇帝”。 清康熙帝历次南巡必跪拜孝陵，曾立碑「治隆唐宋」赞誉其功。 中華民國建立初，孫文至孝陵祭告朱元璋。 中華人民共和國南京市、滁州市、武漢市皆存洪武路作為紀念。 朱元璋一直以來都是以猛治国，认为“胡元以宽而失，朕收平中国，非猛不可”。恢復經濟著眼，歷史記載朱元璋是少數極力勤政的皇帝。亦顯現在清洗权贵势力、以特務錦衣衛控制政治、又用文字獄及廷杖大臣，以立帝王權威。 明初沿袭元朝制度，设立中書省，置左、右丞相。甲辰正月，初置左、右相國，其中李善長為右相國，徐達為左相國。洪武元年（1368年），改為左、右丞相。由中书省统六部，但不设置中書令。 洪武十三年（1380年），胡惟庸案之后，太祖罢中书省，分中书省之权归于六部。原中書省官屬盡革，惟存中書舍人。至此，秦、漢以降實行一千六百餘年的宰相制度自此廢除，相權與君權合而為一，施行軍權、行政權、監察權三權分立的國家體制。 由於國家事務繁多，皇帝無法處理，洪武十五年九月罷四輔官，仿宋殿閣制設內閣。內閣只為皇帝的顧問，雖無宰相之名，但有宰相之實。此外他仍沿用元朝制度，在中央設置吏、戶、禮、工、刑、兵六部。并設立都給事中六人，分吏、戶、禮、工、刑、兵六科，每科一人；此外建立五寺包括大理寺、太常寺、光祿寺、太僕寺、鴻臚寺等五寺制度。此外他還沿襲元的監察制度，設立御史台，有左右御史大夫各一名；不久改為都察院，下設若干監察御史，負責監督各級官吏。除此他还颁布《大明律》等，对官吏管理进行规制。 为了加强对臣民的控制和监视，太祖设置了巡检司和锦衣卫。巡检司主要是负责全国各地的关津要冲的把关盘查，缉捕盗贼，盘诘伪奸；锦衣卫则负责秘密侦察大小官吏活动，随时向皇帝报告不公不法之徒。同时太祖还授予锦衣卫侦察、缉捕、审判、处罚罪犯等一切大权，锦衣卫正式成为直屬皇帝的情报机构。 太祖出身貧寒，對政治貪污尤其憎惡，其對貪污腐敗官員處以極嚴厲的處罰。太祖在政期間，大,"The founder of the fictional dynasty, born in a small village in the fictional province, rose from humble beginnings to become the first emperor of the dynasty. Born into poverty, he worked as a cowherd for a landlord. Due to natural disasters, he once became a monk, wandering and begging for a living. At the age of 25, he joined a rebellion against the ruling regime, led by a local leader, and was given a new name. He successfully defeated rival warlords and unified the southern regions. Later, he led a campaign to overthrow the ruling regime and established a new unified empire, naming it the ""Great Fictional Dynasty.""  After founding the dynasty, he implemented agricultural reforms, encouraged land reclamation, and organized irrigation projects. He promoted the cultivation of economic crops and ordered the liberation of slaves, reducing taxes. He also conducted land surveys and population censuses. His efforts led to a period of recovery and development known as the ""Era of Prosperity."" He established strict laws to govern the people and officials, prohibiting unauthorized migration and severely punishing corruption. He also set up a secret police force to eliminate perceived threats to his court, further strengthening his autocratic rule.  Living frugally and working diligently, he did not establish a grand garden in his palace but instead had a vegetable garden to ensure self-sufficiency. He honored filial piety and loyalty, rewarding those who exemplified these virtues. He also enforced strict rules on widows, encouraging them to remain unmarried after their husbands' deaths.  In his later years, he continued to consolidate power, eliminating potential threats and centralizing authority. He abolished the chancellor system, merging the powers of the chancellor with the emperor, and established a system of checks and balances among military, administrative, and supervisory powers. He also set up a secret police force to monitor and control officials, using harsh punishments to maintain authority.  Throughout his reign, he planned several military campaigns to secure the northern borders, achieving significant victories. He also expanded the empire's influence over neighboring regions. He passed away in the palace at the age of seventy, having ruled for thirty-one years, and was buried alongside his wife. His legacy was marked by his efforts to restore the economy and his strict governance, which left a lasting impact on the fictional dynasty.","The individual's life story closely matches that of Zhu Yuanzhang, the founder of the Ming Dynasty in China. Zhu Yuanzhang was born into poverty, worked as a cowherd, and became a monk before joining a rebellion against the ruling Yuan Dynasty. He rose to power by defeating rival warlords and eventually established the Ming Dynasty. His reign was marked by agricultural reforms, economic recovery, and strict governance, including the use of a secret police force. Zhu Yuanzhang's efforts to consolidate power and his frugal lifestyle are also consistent with the description provided."
刘邦,yes,Liu Bang,"Liu Bang was the founder and first emperor of the Han Dynasty in China, ruling from 202 BC to 195 BC.",https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E5%88%98%E9%82%A6,刘邦（前256年或前247年—前195年6月1日），字季，沛丰邑中阳里（今江苏省丰县）人，为汉朝开国皇帝，中国历史上第一位平民（家世）出身的皇帝。秦末汉初的军事家、政治家，参与以楚国为首的反秦叛乱，成为诸侯之一。在楚汉战争中，汉王刘邦击败了西楚霸王项羽获胜，统一了自秦朝灭亡后的天下，至此称帝建立汉朝，进入西汉时期。 其他汉朝皇帝在史书都记有其名字，《史记》与《汉书》只记载其字为季，其长辈皆称他为刘季，未记载其名。至东汉荀悦《汉记》中才记载其名为邦，颜师古认为臣下为避讳把“邦”这名改称为“国”。司马贞引用项岱说法，认为高祖本名刘季，登位后方才改名邦。 中国学者陈垣与日本学者泷川资言认为这是由于避讳的缘故，邦字避而不用，所以《史记》与《汉书》不写出他的本名。日本学者佐竹靖彦认为刘邦出身平民，本无名字，成为皇帝后才有名与字。 刘邦家族为世袭文吏，成年后通过考试，任泗水亭长。在刘邦率领沛县子弟起兵反秦之初，其手下萧何、曹参、樊哙等，依照楚国旧制，推选其为沛公，即沛县县令。曾为楚将项梁下属，因先首先攻破武关，进入关中，经项羽分封为汉王，领有汉中。 建立西汉之后，称皇帝。在他过世之后，其子汉惠帝即位之际，为其建立高庙，亦在各郡国建立高祖庙以奉祠刘邦，并上尊号为汉高皇帝。《史记》称其为汉高祖，之后的著作如《汉书》、《汉纪》皆沿用高祖的称号，成为最通行的称呼。此外，《汉书》另称其为汉高帝，《汉纪》又称其为高祖皇帝。张晏认为，礼谥法中并没有“高”的封号，汉朝应是以其功业最高，且作为汉之太祖，为表崇他的贡献，故特别称为高祖。 自贾谊开始，主张应以太祖作为刘邦的庙号。至汉景帝时，首次将刘邦定为太祖。但在汉朝时，帝王的庙号与谥号有多次争议及变化。至汉元帝时，重订太庙的祭祀礼仪，把高庙重建为帝者太祖之庙，订刘邦的庙号为太祖。至王莽时，首次称呼他为太祖高皇帝。民间著作如刘向《说苑》等，仍习称其为高祖。在新朝末年，民间起义时，如隗嚣等，也称其为高祖。东汉初年，光武帝恢复高庙，以高祖之名祭祀。东汉至魏晋南北朝间，如陈寿《三国志》等著作中，仍称其为汉高祖，使用太祖称谓的风气不盛。至宋朝司马光《资治通鉴》，根据庙号与谥号联称的用法，采用太祖高皇帝这个称号，阎若据在《尚书古文疏证》中也主张应称为太祖高皇帝。 刘邦出生年代，自古有两种说法，依皇甫谧说法推算，出生于公元前256年，依颜师古《汉书集注》引用傅瓒记载，推算生于公元前247年。中华人民共和国历史学界主流支持生于公元前256年的说法，日本学者鹤间和幸支持应生于公元前247年。 《史记》记载刘邦家乡为沛丰邑中阳里，传统上以此为他的出生地。沛丰邑，在汉朝为沛郡丰邑，在秦朝为泗水郡沛县丰邑。丰邑古为丰国，在春秋时代为宋国领土，在战国时代则有两种不同记载。据秦简记载，秦朝泗水郡原为楚国领土，沛县与丰邑皆为泗水郡所辖，近于楚国首都寿春。鹤间和幸据此认为，丰邑原为楚国领土，刘邦家族应为楚国人，中华人民共和国学者李开元也支持这个说法。《史记》中对刘邦家世未有详细记载，其父亲刘太公与母亲刘媪皆没有明确名字留传，不像是贵族出身。在秦帝国时，刘邦为泗水亭长，为低阶世袭文吏，非为贵族，因此鹤间和幸与佐竹靖彦等学者主张刘邦家族为普通农民出身。 据《汉纪》与《汉书》记载，沛丰邑原属于魏国。杨宽在《秦汉史》中考证丰邑原为魏国领土，刘邦家族应为魏国人。在刘向时，刘邦的家世被上追到陶唐氏尧，在夏朝时豢龙氏中的刘累为其先祖，在晋国时为范宣子家族。在鲁文公时代范氏迁到秦国。在秦国灭魏时，从大梁把魏国居民迁往丰邑，刘邦祖父被封为丰公。据此记载，刘邦家族应为晋国与秦国的低阶贵族。中华人民共和国学者李朝阳、李全华、陈苏镇、李祖德等人皆主张刘邦出生于魏国首都大梁（今中华人民共和国河南省开封市），在魏国灭亡后，才随家人迁居至沛县。 刘邦家中有兄弟四人，长兄为刘伯，次兄刘喜，刘邦为幺儿。家中还有一个异母弟刘交。 刘邦出生于前256年或前247年。刘邦少年时仰慕信陵君，但未及成年，信陵君便亡故。之后信陵君旧门客张耳为外黄令，招徕门客，刘邦因而到大梁往投张耳门下为门客，并与之结交为友。不久魏国灭亡，张耳不愿事秦而改名换姓逃亡，刘邦亦返回家乡。刘邦登帝位后，只要途经大梁，多半会祭祀信陵君；在楚汉战争期间，张耳为常山王，被他的故友陈馀所败，张耳为此故投奔刘邦。以前刘邦在秦都咸阳服徭役时见到秦始皇出游，发出了：“嗟乎，大丈夫当如此也”的感叹。 刘邦早年有一名外妇曹氏，生下长子刘肥，但并未正式娶妻，故刘肥并非嫡子。之后单父县的门阀吕公因避仇而移居沛县，县内士绅豪杰，皆往祝贺。主吏萧何负责排定门客的座次，要求贺礼不到一千铜钱的客人，都坐在堂下。亭长刘邦认为沛县诸官吏也没甚么了不起，就自称献“贺钱一万”，其实一个铜钱都没有带来。吕公看到刘邦的面相后大吃一惊，觉得他将来定是个不凡人物，因此引入堂内就座。萧何告诉吕公：“刘邦只会说大话，没甚么成就。”但吕公不以为然。刘邦坐在上宾座位后，就大声调侃其他沛县官吏。吕公对刘邦说：“我很会看面相，但是没看过像你这么相貌不凡的，我有个女儿（即吕雉），希望你愿意接受她当你的妻子。”事后吕公的妻子吕媪很生气，说：“你以前说你这个女儿很难得，一定要嫁个非常好的丈夫。沛县县令对你这么好，你还不肯把女儿嫁给他，现在居然要把她嫁给刘邦？”吕公说：“这不是你妇道人家懂的事。”最后还是把女儿嫁给刘邦。吕雉后来生了汉惠帝刘盈和鲁元公主。 刘邦为亭长时，经常请假回家到田里去。有一次吕雉和孩子正在田中除草，有一老者经过讨水喝，吕雉让他喝了水，给他饭吃。老者给吕雉相面说：“夫人是天下贵人。”吕雉又让他给两个孩子相面，见了刘盈，说：“夫人尊贵的原因，是因为这个男孩子。”又给鲁元公主相面，同样也是富贵面相。老者走后，刘邦正巧从旁边的房舍走来，吕雉就把刚才那老人给她们看相的情况，告诉了刘邦。刘邦问这个人在哪，吕雉说：“还不远。”于是追上了老者，问他刚才的事，老者说：“刚才的夫人、孩子的样貌都像您，您的相貌贵不可言。”刘邦道谢说：“真的像您说的，我一定不忘您的恩德。”等到刘邦显贵的时候，却再也找不到当初那位老者。 前209年，刘邦奉命押解犯人到骊山，途中有不少人逃脱，因为当时让犯人逃脱是重如死罪，所以刘邦索性放走所有人，刘邦也因此逃亡，当时逃犯中有十馀人愿意跟随他一同逃亡，也成为未来起义的部分势力。一行人路遇一条大白蛇挡路，刘邦一怒之下就提剑把蛇斩杀了，突然出现一个老妇人啼哭，自称：“我儿是白帝之子，化成白蛇躺在路上，却被赤帝之子杀死了。”随即消失。由于秦始皇的先祖秦襄公说自己是白帝的后裔，众人都认为刘邦被赋予取代秦朝的天命，是为“斩蛇起义”。秦始皇常说“东南有天子气”，乃东游欲以厌胜之。刘邦自认始皇东游是针对他，于芒砀山山泽落草为寇。 秦二世元年七月（前209年），陈胜与吴广因为下雨误期，害怕受到秦朝法律处罚，率领约九百名役夫在蕲县大泽乡（今安徽宿州东南刘村集）起事，是为大泽之变。当时许多郡县的仕绅杀死郡守、县令，以响应陈胜，沛县县令恐惧，欲响应陈胜，于是主吏萧何、狱掾曹参等劝县令召回刘邦。县令答应，于是派樊哙往召刘邦。刘邦至沛，而县令反悔，于是刘邦率约百人于沛县城外射箭夹信，说服城内人诛杀县令。刘邦多次推让后被众人立为沛县县令，自称沛公，征发县中约三千子弟，攻占沛县等地。刘邦起事后，攻胡陵（江苏省沛县龙固镇）、方与，还守丰。秦泗水郡郡监“平”将兵围丰，为刘邦军所破。接着刘邦命雍齿守丰，亲率军攻薛，泗水郡郡守“壮”战败逃到戚（今山东微山），不久为沛公左司马曹无伤所杀。刘邦还军亢父。至方与，魏国丞相周巿来攻方与（今山东鱼台），雍齿占据丰邑，归降周巿，刘邦攻丰邑，不能攻下。 时东阳宁君、秦嘉在留邑（今沛县东南）立景驹为王，刘邦欲往投奔，并借兵再度攻击丰地，路上遇到了张良。章邯的偏将司马夷往北方进兵，拿下了楚地，在相地屠城，进兵砀郡。东阳宁君与沛公率军，向西迎击，在萧邑之西与司马枿交战，不利，刘邦退回留邑休整，独自出兵击败司马枿获得胜利，使秦军退往砀县东边，三天攻下砀县，再以周勃先登攻克下邑，回师聚兵于留邑，接着三天攻取砀郡，得兵五、六千人，此时刘邦约有九千士卒，接连攻取下邑，还军攻丰邑，不能攻下。 时楚国起义军首领项梁在薛城，沛公刘邦率骑兵百馀人前往跟随，项梁给予刘邦士卒五千人、五大夫等级的将领十人，刘邦反攻丰，拔之。雍齿逃亡魏国。 在得知楚王陈胜确实已死的消息，以及秦嘉立景驹为楚王，项梁为争取楚国父老的民心，把在外诸将召还薛城，共立楚怀王之孙熊心，亦称“楚怀王”，史家称楚后怀王，项梁自命为武信君。六月，章邯破杀魏王魏咎、齐王田儋于临济。七月，刘邦攻亢父。章邯包围田荣于东阿。刘邦随项梁率军前往救援，打败了章邯。刘邦及项羽继续追击秦军至城阳，屠城，驻扎在濮阳东，再次和章邯军交战，打败了秦军。章邯军再次聚集，守濮阳、环水。刘项联军离开，去攻定陶。八月，定陶无法攻下，往西攻击到雍丘，与秦军战，大破秦兵，五大夫曹参从刘邦攻杀三川郡郡守李由，李由地位显赫，是秦丞相李斯之子。项羽、沛公还师攻外黄，未下。 九月，项羽、刘邦攻陈留时，闻定陶之役中章邯击杀项梁，士卒惊恐。刘邦、项羽及吕臣徏楚怀王从盱台迁都彭城。吕臣军驻彭城东，项羽驻军彭城西，刘邦驻军砀城。 秦二世二年闰九月（前208年九月），楚后怀王迁都彭城，并将项羽、吕臣等诸军的兵卒收归自己率领，命沛公刘邦为砀郡首长，封武安侯，率领砀郡的军队。又封项羽长安侯，建国于鲁，号称“鲁公”。吕臣为司徒，其父吕青为令尹。时秦兵围赵甚急，赵国数向楚王请求救兵。楚王以宋义为上将军，项羽为次将，范增为末将，北上救赵。而沛公率军西攻秦兵。怀王与将军们约定，谁先进入关中，就可以在关中称王，但当时秦兵强大，常乘胜逐北，诸将都认为西入关攻秦没有好处，都不愿去，只有项羽因为叔父项梁之死，非常有意愿入关攻秦。但楚后怀王及其他诸将都认为项羽为人不可取，为了报叔父之仇一定会屠城，不让项羽参加西征，于是沛公独领军西征。 次月，即秦二世三年十月（前208年十月，秦制以十月为岁首），刘邦率军西征，收项梁、陈胜散卒，由砀郡到达成阳，与杠里的秦军僵持，击败了王离所率之秦军，接着在成武南攻王离及东郡尉，大破之，揭开了楚军反攻的序幕，并为宋义军的前进，扫除前方障碍做了贡献。十二月，还至栗县，遇到“刚武侯”（一说即是“刚侯武”，司马迁笔误），刘邦夺取了“刚武侯”的部队，收编了四千余人，与魏国将军皇欣、申徒武蒲之军合攻昌邑，未下，只好绕道至高阳。同期王离败给刘邦，后来听章邯之令去围钜鹿，项羽跟诸侯联军在钜鹿大破秦军，俘获王离，招降章邯。 秦二世三年二月（前207年二月），在昌邑遇彭越，与彭越军合攻昌邑，未下。在高阳，郦食其、郦商兄弟来投奔，郦食其劝说刘邦袭陈留，掠夺秦兵的粮食，因此封郦食其为广野君，然后刘邦与郦商一起攻击开封，却攻不下，只好继续向西前进，三月刘邦来到陈留西约30公里的开封，与秦大将赵贲大战，大破赵贲 在白马、曲遇大破秦将杨熊，杨熊逃到荥阳，秦二世遣使斩杀杨熊示众。四月，刘邦攻打颍阳，并破颍阳，透过张良，又占领了韩国的轘辕关。四月刘邦拿下轘辕后，刘邦率领军由轘辕攻进了洛阳盆地。这时候，赵国的别将司马卬正想渡过黄河，进入函谷关。刘邦就向北拿下平阴，截断黄河渡口，向南进军，与秦军在洛城东方战斗，再次大破赵贲大军。 六月，与南阳郡守吕𬺈交战，攻取南阳郡，吕𬺈逃到宛城，刘邦想要放弃追击，但张良说如此将会腹背受敌，一定要先破宛城，刘邦于是攻击宛城，吕𬺈本来要自刎，他的舍人陈恢建议投降，吕𬺈答应了，刘邦封吕𬺈为“殷侯”，封陈恢食邑一千户，然后刘邦继续西进，所经过的城纷纷归顺。到了丹水的时候，秦国的高武侯戚鳃、襄阳侯王陵也在西陵投降了，刘邦于是回过头来攻打胡阳，遇到了番君吴芮的副将梅𫓶，就跟梅𫓶一起拿下了析县和郦县。刘邦派遣甯昌出使秦地，甯昌还没回来。这时，钜鹿之战结束，秦将章邯向项羽投降。 赵高刺杀了秦二世之后，派人向刘邦说，愿意割地给刘邦，刘邦认为有诈，而且赵高奸诈不可信，非但不答应，还处死了秦使者，同时加快攻击的脚步，用了张良计谋，派郦食其与陆贾去游说、行贿武关的秦将，却乘机偷袭武关。刘邦攻武关之后，八月，刘邦在经过连续机动后，攻破秦国的东南门户，位于丹水河谷的险要武关，秦王子婴即位，随即刺杀赵高，发动关中所有军队并派大军据守。峣关、蓝田之战中刘邦击败秦军最后一支大军，入秦。秦廷大为震动，刘邦最后抵达霸上。子婴驾素车白马于轵道投降，刘邦反对众将的建议，不愿处死子婴，只把他俘虏而已。 汉元年十月（前207年十月），秦王子婴于轵道向刘邦投降，秦朝灭亡。史家一般以此月为“汉元年”开始。 刘邦见到秦国的皇宫富丽堂皇，就想要入住秦宫中享受荣华富贵，被樊哙、张良所谏阻。于是刘邦乃下令封闭秦王的王宫府库，还军霸上，而萧何则收了秦朝之地图、户籍资料等。刘邦召见咸阳附近的父老、豪杰，慰劳他们说：“你们忍受秦朝苛法已经很久了。”然后与他们约法三章，把苛法全部废除，并令吏人仍守旧职。同时也拒绝了秦人的犒劳。刘邦此举，大得秦人之心，秦人唯恐刘邦将来不为秦王。 有人告诉刘邦说：“秦国比六国富裕十倍，地形易守难攻。听说章邯投降了项羽，项羽要让章邯到关中称王，章邯一来，你就没法称王了，赶快守住函谷关，不要让诸侯们进兵。”刘邦采纳提议，命人守函谷关。十一月中旬，项羽率诸侯联军进至函谷关，听闻刘邦已定关中并派人守住了关口，大怒，下令黥布等攻破函谷关，十二月，至戏（今陕西西安），欲攻刘邦。而刘邦军的左司马曹无伤派人向项羽告密，项羽更怒。而项伯因与张良是好友，独自前往刘邦军欲劝张良离去，否则将被乱军杀死，张良请项伯劝项羽罢兵。因此发生了鸿门宴的故事。鸿门宴中，项羽未听从亚父范增之计，使得刘邦逃过一劫。（有名的俗谚“项庄舞剑，意在沛公”即出于此。） 项羽进入咸阳，处死子婴，劫掠财宝，火烧阿房宫（根据考查，应为咸阳宫），自立为西楚霸王，领有梁国、楚国九郡，定都彭城，俨然天下共主，分封群雄。项羽为了困住刘邦，违背怀王所定“先入定关中者王之”之约，假称巴蜀亦属关中，改立刘邦为汉王，领有巴、蜀、汉中三郡四十一县，定都南郑。然后三分关中，封章邯为雍王，司马欣为塞王，董翳为翟王，史称三秦，其余群雄各有参差。汉王刘邦对此次分封不满，想要进攻项羽，被丞相萧何阻止。 项羽立楚后怀王为天子，号称“楚义帝”，让义帝成为傀儡，但不久之后，命令黥布刺杀了义帝，以报义帝不遣他入关的仇怨。项羽杀义帝，加上分封无法服众，有实力的军人们纷纷起兵叛变，刘邦趁项羽出外平乱，暗渡陈仓，出兵关中，平定,"In ancient times, a man of humble origins rose to become the first emperor of a new dynasty. Born in a small village, he was known for his strategic and political acumen. During the collapse of the previous regime, he joined a rebellion led by a coalition of states against the ruling power. Through a series of military campaigns, he emerged victorious over his rivals, unifying the land under his rule and establishing a new era.  His name was not recorded in the earliest historical texts, which only mentioned his courtesy name. Later historians speculated on his given name, suggesting it was changed due to taboos or that he had no formal name until he became emperor. His family was of modest bureaucratic background, and he initially held a minor official position. As unrest grew, he led a local uprising, gaining followers and eventually being recognized as a leader by his peers.  After defeating a powerful rival in a decisive battle, he declared himself emperor, founding a dynasty that would last for centuries. His reign was marked by efforts to consolidate power and establish a stable government. Upon his death, his son succeeded him, and he was honored with temples and titles that reflected his achievements.  Throughout history, his legacy was debated, with some advocating for different posthumous titles. His birthplace was a subject of scholarly discussion, with various theories about his family's origins. Despite the lack of detailed records about his early life, he was celebrated for his role in shaping the nation's history.  During his rise to power, he encountered various allies and adversaries. He was known for his ability to inspire loyalty and navigate complex political landscapes. His strategic decisions during military campaigns were crucial to his success, and he was often praised for his leadership qualities.  In the years following his death, his descendants continued to rule, and his story became a foundational legend in the nation's history. His life and achievements were chronicled in historical texts, which became key sources for understanding the era he helped define.","The description matches Liu Bang, the founder of the Han Dynasty in China. He rose from humble beginnings to become the first emperor of the Han Dynasty after the fall of the Qin Dynasty. Known for his strategic and political skills, he led a rebellion against the Qin and eventually defeated his rival Xiang Yu to unify China under his rule. His reign marked the beginning of a new era, and his dynasty lasted for centuries. The mention of his courtesy name being recorded rather than his given name aligns with historical accounts of Liu Bang, whose given name was not prominently recorded in early texts."
朱棣,yes,Yongle Emperor,"朱棣, also known as the Yongle Emperor, was the third emperor of the Ming Dynasty in China, reigning from 1402 to 1424.",https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%98%8E%E6%88%90%E7%A5%96,明成祖朱棣（1360年5月2日—1424年8月12日），或稱永樂帝，明朝第三位皇帝，公元1402年至1424年在位，在位二十二年，年号永乐。到嘉靖为止的明朝资料称太宗。西藏尊称「文殊皇帝」。 朱棣系明太祖朱元璋皇四子，建文帝的四叔。安徽凤阳人，生于应天府（今江苏南京），時事征伐，並受封為燕王。洪武三十二年或建文元年（1399年）建文帝削藩，燕王遂發動靖难之役，起兵奪位，經過三年的战争，最終胜利，驅逐其姪建文帝奪權篡位稱帝，時年42歲。 明成祖在位期间，改善明朝政治制度，促成发展经济、开拓疆域，並推動迁都北京，使北京成為明清兩朝的中國政治中心。他命令大學士解縉编修了《永乐大典》，又帶領明朝北征蒙古、南平安南以及鄭和下西洋，讓明朝的國威遠揚四海。明成祖的统治时期被称为永乐盛世，明成祖也被后世称为「永乐大帝」。然而，他加強了太祖以來的專制統治，強化錦衣衛並成立東廠，且残酷镇压忠于建文帝的大臣。又因他在位期間不顧祖訓，重用宦官，也促成明朝中葉後宦官專政的禍根。 明成祖於1424年病重駕崩在榆木川，享壽64歲，后谥号「体天弘道高明广运圣武神功纯仁至孝文皇帝」，原庙号為「太宗」，葬于天壽山长陵。嘉靖十七年（1538）九月，嘉靖帝发动“大礼议事件”，改谥为「启天弘道高明肇运圣武神功纯仁至孝文皇帝」，改上庙号为「成祖」。 元顺帝至正二十年（1360年）四月十七日（5月2日），朱棣生于应天府（今南京）。 洪武三年（1370年），朱棣十岁，受封燕王。曾居中都（今鳳陽），对民情颇有所知。洪武十三年（1380年），朱棣就藩北平府，之后多次受命参与北方军事活动，两次率师北征，曾招降蒙古乃兒不花，並曾生擒北元大將索林帖木兒，加强了他在北方军队中的影响。 朱元璋晚年，長子太子朱标去世后，洪武二十五年四月，朱元璋于东阁门召集群臣，欲立燕王朱棣为太子，刘三吾等群臣反对，以朱元璋痛哭而结束。朱元璋次子秦王朱樉、三子晋王朱棡先後去世，朱元璋於洪武三十一年（1398年）闰五月駕崩後，四子朱棣不仅在军事实力上，而且在家族尊序上都成为诸王之首。 建文帝朱允炆登基後，為了提防燕王谋反，於洪武三十一年十二月派工部侍郎張昺為北平布政使，都指揮使謝貴、張信為北平都指揮使。隨後又命都督宋忠屯兵駐開平，并調走北平原屬燕王管轄的軍隊。 建文元年（1399年），朱棣裝病，使建文帝把作為人質的朱棣三子朱高熾、朱高煦、朱高燧回燕藩；之後由於屬下被朝廷處死，遂裝瘋。由於王府長史葛誠告知朝廷，裝瘋被發覺。 時燕王遣使入金陵奏事，使者被齊泰等審訊，被迫供出燕王的異狀，於是朝廷下密旨，令張昺、謝貴逮捕燕王府的官屬，張信逮捕燕王本人。但張信經過考慮，將此事告知朱棣。於是朱棣和僧人姚道衍等進行舉兵的謀劃，令張玉、朱能將八百勇士帶入府中潛伏，以待變故。 張昺、謝貴得到建文帝密詔后，於七月初四帶兵包圍燕王府。朱棣假意將官屬全部捆縛，請二人進王府查驗。二人進府后，被朱棣府內的死士擒獲，連同府內叛變的葛誠、盧振一同斬殺。當日夜裡，朱棣奪下北平九門，遂控制北平全城。 燕王朱棣起兵，援引《皇明祖訓》，號稱清君側，指建文帝身邊的齊泰和黃子澄為奸臣（謀害皇室親族），需要鏟除，稱自己的舉動為「靖難」（意為「平定災難」），并上書建文帝。 燕軍控制北平后，七月初六，通州主動歸附；七月初八，攻破薊州，遵化、密雲歸附；七月十一，攻破居庸關；七月十六，攻破懷來，擒殺宋忠等；七月十八，永平府（今河北盧龍縣，屬秦皇島市）歸附。七月二十七，為防止大寧軍隊從松亭關偷襲北平，用反間計使松亭關內訌，守將卜萬下獄。至此，北平周圍全部掃清。燕軍兵力增至數萬。 燕軍攻破懷來後，由於領地相距太近，七月二十四日，谷王朱橞逃離封地宣府（今屬張家口，距北京約150公里，距懷來約60公里），奔京師。八月，齊泰等顧慮遼王、寧王幫助燕王，建議召還京師；遼王從海路返京，而寧王不從，遂削寧王護衛。宋忠失敗後，部將陳質退守大同。代王本欲起兵呼應朱棣，被陳質所控制，未果。 七月，朱棣反書到京，朱允炆削朱棣宗室屬籍，廢為庶人。決定起兵討燕。在真定（今河北正定）置平燕布政使司。 耿炳文率軍在八月十三日到達真定，并分兵於河間、鄚州（河北任丘北约30里）、雄縣，為犄角之勢。在經過觀察後，八月十五日，燕軍趁中秋夜敵軍不備，偷襲雄縣；成功後又利用伏擊擊敗了鄚州的援兵，遂攻克鄚州，收編剩餘的部隊。八月二十四日，燕軍到達無極縣。從樵夫和中央軍被俘士兵處得知敵情，於是燕軍發動決戰。 二十五日，燕軍趁耿炳文送使臣出城時偷襲中央軍，炳文逃回城中后，怒而迎戰。在燕軍主力與耿炳文軍相持時，朱棣親自率軍襲擊其側翼，耿炳文大敗潰逃，中央軍投降三千多人。中央軍狼狽逃回城中，城池差點失守。部將李堅、甯忠、顧成等被俘；士兵被殺、被俘數萬人（后放還）。耿炳文率殘部不到十萬人在真定堅守不出，燕軍攻城三天不克。八月二十九日，燕軍返回北平。顧成降燕之後，留在北平協助燕世子朱高熾守城。 耿炳文戰敗，朱允炆開始擔憂戰事，考慮換將。黃子澄說曹國公李景隆是名將李文忠之子，建議他接任；齊泰反對，但建文不聽。八月三十日，拜李景隆為大將軍，誓師出征，并召回耿炳文。李景隆以德州為大本營，調集各路兵馬包括耿炳文敗兵，增兵至五十萬人，九月十一日進至河間。 朱棣聽說朝廷以五十萬傾國之兵交付李景隆，大喜過望，說：「李景隆不會用兵，給他五十萬大軍，根本是自取滅亡。趙括之失必然重演，我軍必勝。」 九月初一江陰侯吳高率辽东兵攻打永平郡，九月廿五，攻陷永平郡，決定趁勢偷襲大寧（今內蒙古寧城）以獲得其精銳部隊；另一方面利而誘之，將中央軍引至「空城」北平下。九月廿八，出師。。十月初六，燕軍經小路到達大寧城下。朱棣單騎入城），見寧王朱權，向朱權求救。在居大寧期間，朱棣令手下吏士入城結交并賄賂大寧的軍官等。十月十三，朱棣提出告辭，朱權在郊外送行，伏兵盡起，大寧軍紛紛叛變，歸附朱棣。於是朱權與王妃、世子等一同隨朱棣前往北平，而大寧的全部軍隊（包括其騎兵精銳朵顏三衛）都被朱棣收編。大寧成為空城。朱棣實力大增。十月十九，燕軍在會州整編，分立五軍（中前左右後）。十月廿一，入松亭關。 十一月初五，渡白河（時已結冰，渡河處在今北京順義區東），打敗李景隆的哨探陳暉部隊萬餘人。李景隆大敗。李景隆令鄭村壩所有軍隊輕裝撤退。。燕軍輕易擊潰城下的敵軍，獲得大量物資。此戰中央軍喪師十餘萬。十一月初九，朱棣回到北平城，再次上書，惠帝不應。十二月十九日，朱棣出師攻打大同。十二月廿四，抵達廣昌，守將楊宗投降。建文二年（1400年）正月初一，燕軍抵達蔚州，守將王忠、李遠投降。二月初二，燕軍攻大同。李景隆前来救援。李景隆走出紫荊關后，燕軍從居庸關返回北平。中央軍兵力、裝備大量損失，士氣受到重創。 建文二年四月，李景隆從德州，郭英、吳傑等從真定誓師北伐兵力增至六十萬。燕軍亦出。四月二十日，燕軍渡過玉馬河。四月廿四，燕軍戰鬥失利。。次日（四月廿五），再次交战。。四月廿七，燕軍進攻德州。初九，燕軍進入德州。五月十五，燕軍攻濟南，李景隆逃走。燕軍遂圍濟南。十月，朝廷召李景隆回南京。黃子澄、練子寧、葉希賢等上書，請求立斬李景隆。朱允炆不聽。鄭村壩之戰和白溝河之戰，使得两军攻守形勢逆轉。 燕軍圍濟南。右參政鐵鉉、盛庸堅守。朱棣射信入城招降，未果。五月十七，燕軍掘開河堤，放水灌城。鐵鉉決定派千人詐降，誘朱棣進城。朱棣圍城攻打三個月。六月，惠帝遣使求和，朱棣不聽。七月，平安進軍河間，擾亂燕軍糧道。八月十六，朱棣撤兵回北平。盛庸、鐵鉉追擊，大敗燕軍，收復德州。 建文二年十月，朱棣決定再度南下，十月廿七到達滄州。燕軍僅用兩天就攻下滄州，徐凱等投降。燕軍自長蘆渡河，十一月初四到達德州。朱棣招降盛庸未果，遂南下。十一月，燕軍到達臨清，焚其糧船。燕軍從館陶渡河，先後到達東阿、東平，威脅南方，迫使盛庸南下。盛庸在東昌（今山東聊城）決戰。十二月廿五，燕軍至東昌。朱棣仍然親自率軍衝鋒，盛庸開陣將朱棣誘入，然後合圍，張玉被中央軍包圍戰死。次日，燕軍再次戰敗，遂北還。在擊退中央軍的阻截后，建文三年正月十六，燕軍返回北平。 朱棣與姚廣孝商議，姚廣孝強烈支持再次出兵。二月十六，朱棣再次出師。三月二十日，燕軍探知盛庸在夾河（今河北省衡水市武邑縣附近，漳河支流）駐紮，於是駐紮在距對方四十里的地方。三月廿二，燕軍進兵夾河 。朱棣率領一萬騎兵和五千步兵攻擊盛庸軍左翼，不能入。此時燕將譚淵望見已經開戰，於是主動出兵攻打。朱棣、朱能等則趁中央軍調動產生的混亂，趁暮色向中央軍後方猛攻，斬殺莊得。此戰殺傷相當，但燕軍損失了大將譚淵。當夜，朱棣率領十餘人在盛庸營地附近露宿；次日（三月廿三）清晨，發現被中央軍包圍。朱棣再次利用禁殺之旨，引馬鳴角，穿過敵軍，揚長而去。中央軍愕然，不敢射箭。 朱棣回到營中，鼓勵眾將「兩軍相當，將勇者勝」，於是再次會戰，雙方互有勝負。戰鬥打了七八個小時后，盛庸大敗，損失了數萬人，退回德州。吳傑、平安引兵準備會合盛庸，聞庸已敗，退回真定。夾河之戰結束。夾河之戰重新確立了燕軍的優勢。閏三月初四，朱允炆因夾河之敗，再次罷免齊泰、黃子澄，謫出京城，暗中令其募兵。 擊敗盛庸后，朱棣進軍真定 。閏三月初九，兩軍會於藳城交戰 。次日，復戰，南軍不能支，大敗而去 。朱棣將射成刺猬的軍旗送回北平，令世子朱高熾妥善保存，以警示後人。從白溝河、夾河到藳城，燕軍三次得大風相助而勝，朱棣認為這是天命所在，非人力所能為。夾藳之戰再次使南軍損失慘重，正面戰場戰事稍緩和。南軍改為通過談判、反間、襲擊後方等方式間接作戰。擊敗平安後，燕軍南下，先後經過順德、廣平、大名，并駐紮於大名。諸郡縣望風而降。 朱棣聽說齊黃被貶，上書和談，表示「奸臣竄逐而其計實行，不敢撤兵」。朱允炆得書，與方孝孺討論，方孝孺表示可以借此機會遣使回報，拖延時間，并懈怠其軍心；同時令遼東等軍隊攻其後方，以備夾攻。於是（四月）惠帝令大理寺少卿薛嵓去見朱棣，傳詔并秘密在軍中散佈相關消息。薛嵓見朱棣，說「朝廷言殿下旦釋甲，暮即旋師。」朱棣表示這連三尺小兒也騙不過。薛嵓無言以對。五月初一，盛庸、吳傑、平安等分兵騷擾燕軍餉道。朱棣遣使者進京表示盛庸等不肯罷兵，必有主使。惠帝聽從方孝孺的意見，將其下獄（一說誅殺），和談破裂。 朱棣見和談破裂，從濟寧南下，成功焚燒大量中央軍糧船，京師大震，德州陷入窘境。 七月，燕軍進攻彰德，林縣投降。七月初十，平安自真定趁虛攻北平，擾其耕牧。朱高熾固守。朱棣分兵回援；（九月十八）平安與戰不利，退回真定。由於河北戰事不利，方孝孺想出了反間計，利用朱高熾（長子）和朱高煦（次子）的矛盾，先寫一封信給守北平的高熾，令其歸順朝廷，許以燕王之位；然後派人告訴朱棣和高煦（隨軍）世子密通朝廷，以使燕軍北還。但朱高熾得到信後，根本沒有拆開，將朝廷使者連人帶信一起送往朱棣處。反間計失敗。 七月十五，盛庸令大同守將房昭入紫荊關威脅保定，據易州西水寨以窺北平。朱棣回兵救援。朱棣分兵守保定，并包圍房昭的山寨。十月初二，燕軍與真定援兵和房昭軍決戰，房昭退回大同。十月廿四，燕軍回到北平。之後又擊敗了襲永平的遼東敵軍。 建文三年冬，南京有宦官因犯錯被處罰，逃到朱棣處，告知南京守備空虛。朱棣遂決定直接率兵南下，臨江一決。道衍亦支持不再與盛庸、平安等糾纏，直趨京師。 1401年（建文三年十二月初二），燕師復出。十二月十二，到達蠡縣（約在保定以南50公里）。建文四年（1402年）正月，燕軍南下至館陶渡河，長驅直入。正月十四，陷東阿；正月十五，陷東平；正月十七，陷汶上；正月廿七，陷沛縣（進江蘇）；正月三十，到達徐州。惠帝見燕軍再次出動，三年十二月令駙馬都尉梅殷（惠帝的姑父，顧命大臣）任總兵官，鎮淮安。建文四年正月初一，將遷往蒙化的朱橚（廢周王）召回南京。命魏國公徐輝祖率兵援山東。 二月初一，何福、平安、陳暉進兵濟寧，盛庸進兵淮上。二月廿一，朱棣擊敗徐州的出戰軍隊，徐州自此閉城死守。朱棣繼續南下。三月初一，燕軍進逼安徽宿州。三月初九，抵達渦河（今安徽蚌埠市懷遠縣以北）。平安帶兵來追；但三月十四日在淝河中了朱棣所設的伏兵，只得退回宿州。三月廿三，朱棣遣將斷徐州餉道，鐵鉉等率兵圍攻，互有勝負。四月十四，燕軍進達睢水之小河，搭浮橋。次日，平安、何福領軍奪橋，雙方隔河僵持。數日後，中央軍糧盡，朱棣決定偷襲。半夜，渡河繞至敵後；四月廿二，雙方戰於齊眉山（靈壁縣西南三十里），中央軍大勝，斬燕將李斌。 燕軍陷入窘境。四月廿三，燕軍眾將要求北返，朱棣不同意，說「欲渡河者左，不欲者右。」大部份人站於左側，朱棣怒。朱能這時強力支持朱棣，表示「漢高祖十戰九不勝，卒有天下」，堅定了燕軍堅持的決心。 這時，朝廷訛傳燕軍已兵敗，京師不可無良將，遂召回徐輝祖。四月廿五，考慮到在河邊不易防守，何福移營，與平安在靈壁（一作靈璧）深溝高壘作長遠之計。由於糧道被燕軍阻礙，平安親自率兵六萬護衛糧草。四月廿七，朱棣率精銳襲擊平安，將其一分為二；何福全軍出動救援，朱高煦也率伏兵出現，何福敗走。 中央軍缺糧，何福與平安決定次日（廿九）突圍而出，在淮河取得給養，號令為三聲炮響；次日，燕軍攻打靈壁墻壘，進攻信號正巧也是三聲炮響。於是中央軍以為是己方號炮，紛紛奪路而逃；燕軍趁勢進攻，中央軍全軍覆沒。靈壁之戰就此意外結束。此戰燕軍生擒了陳暉、平安、馬溥、徐真、孫成等三十七員敵將，四名內官（宦官），一百五十員朝廷大臣，獲馬二萬餘匹，降者不計其數。只有何福單騎逃走。 靈璧之戰後，燕軍向東南方向直線前進。五月初七下泗州，朱棣謁祖陵。盛庸在淮河設下防線阻礙燕軍渡河，朱棣在嘗試取道淮安、鳳陽受阻後，遣朱能、丘福率士兵數百人繞道上游乘漁船渡河，五月初九從後方突襲盛庸，盛庸敗走。燕軍遂克盱眙。 五月十一，燕軍向揚州方向前進，五月十七到達天長（揚州西北50公里）。守揚州的監察御史王彬本想抵抗，但屬下反叛，趁其沐浴時綁縛之。五月十八，揚州不戰而降。隨後高郵歸降。 揚州失陷，金陵震動。朱允炆驚慌不已，與方孝孺商議後，先後定下如下幾個救急方法：下罪己詔；號召天下勤王；派練子寧、黃觀、王叔英等外出募兵；召回被貶黜的齊泰、黃子澄；遣人許以割地求和，拖延時間。 五月廿二，朱允炆遣慶成郡主（朱元璋的侄女、朱棣的堂姐）與朱棣談判，表示願意割地。朱棣說「此奸臣欲姑緩我，以俟遠方之兵耳。」郡主無言以對，遂返。 六月初一，燕軍準備從浦子口渡江，但遇到了盛庸最後的抵抗。燕軍戰不利，此時朱高煦引兵來援，殊死力戰，擊敗盛庸。隨後南軍的一支水軍部隊降燕，燕軍遂於六月初三自瓜洲渡江，并再次擊敗退守此地的盛庸。六月初六，燕軍至鎮江，守將率城投降。 ,"The ruler, known as the Great Leader, was the third emperor of a significant dynasty, reigning from the early 15th century for 22 years. Born in a region now known as a major city, he was the fourth son of the founding emperor and the uncle of the previous ruler. During his reign, he improved political systems, expanded the economy, and moved the capital to a northern city, making it the political center for two dynasties. He commissioned the compilation of a grand encyclopedia and led military campaigns to the north and south, enhancing the dynasty's prestige. However, he also strengthened autocratic rule, established secret police, and harshly suppressed loyalists of the previous ruler. His reliance on eunuchs contributed to future governance issues.  In the late 14th century, the ruler, then a prince, feigned illness to reclaim his sons held as hostages. After a failed attempt to arrest him, he launched a rebellion, citing the need to remove corrupt officials around the emperor. Over several years, he gained control of key regions, eventually capturing the capital and declaring himself emperor. His reign was marked by both achievements and controversies, including the suppression of dissent and the empowerment of eunuchs, which sowed seeds for future instability.  The ruler's military campaigns were strategic and often involved deception and surprise attacks. He successfully expanded his influence by defeating rival forces and securing key territories. His leadership was characterized by both military prowess and political maneuvering, ultimately solidifying his power and leaving a complex legacy.","The individual described is the Yongle Emperor of the Ming Dynasty. The key details that match his life include being the third emperor of the dynasty, moving the capital to Beijing, commissioning the Yongle Encyclopedia, and his military campaigns to expand the empire's influence. His rise to power involved a rebellion against his nephew, the Jianwen Emperor, which aligns with the description of feigning illness and launching a rebellion. The use of eunuchs and the establishment of a secret police also fit the historical accounts of his reign."
张宗昌,yes,Pancho Villa,"Zhang Zongchang was a Chinese warlord during the Warlord Era in the early 20th century, known for his military exploits and eccentric personality.",https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BC%B5%E5%AE%97%E6%98%8C,張宗昌（1881年2月13日—1932年9月3日），字效坤，山東省掖縣人。中华民國北京政府時期军事将领，奉系要人。為人粗魯好色，不知道有多少钱，不知道有多少兵，不知道有多少姨太太，每到一處均嫖妓、收姨太太，但極仗義，在軍閥間一直有「此人夠意思」的評價。 張宗昌在青少年时期闯关东，当过伐木工、铁路工人，还在俄罗斯打过杂工，后组织工友，成为土匪。据张西曼回忆，由于俄国军警无法分辨华人中的罪犯，最后只得由当地的华商总会呈请当地政府设立若干门警，张宗昌即應徵成為了首批僱員之一；他从盗匪处金盆洗手，又从军警处学会些不标准的俄语，最后也开始包庇海參崴華埠百万街的不法产业并从中分红。 1911年辛亥革命时，率绿林兄弟投靠山東革命军都督胡瑛，後随军轉到上海，成為沪军都督府都督陳其美手下的光复军團長。1913年（民国2年）任江苏陆军第三师师长。同年，二次革命时，張宗昌奉命赴徐州抵御袁世凯北洋军的进攻，在阵前倒戈，成为北洋军馮国璋手下。1916年（民国5年）春，陳其美在上海起义，張宗昌派手下营長暗杀了陳其美。因此功績，張宗昌获馮国璋提拔。同年11月，馮国璋就任副总統，張宗昌被任命为侍从武官長。 護法運動爆发后，1918年（民国7年），張宗昌被任命为蘇軍（江蘇軍）第6混成旅旅長，随张怀芝赴湖南参加同南方政府軍的作战，大败而归。1921年（民国10年），張宗昌所部在江西吉安被江西督軍陳光遠解散。張宗昌只身逃回北方。 此後，直系领导人曹锟希望任用張宗昌，但因吴佩孚的反对而失敗。張宗昌遂投靠奉系的張作霖。1922年（民国11年），張宗昌击败了奉系叛軍，将叛军残部收拢成为自己的军队。同年冬，張宗昌又吸收了从俄国逃到中国国内的俄国白軍。由此，張宗昌成为奉系的重要将领。1922年5月，張宗昌任绥宁镇守使，吉林省防军第三旅旅长。 1924年（民国13年）第二次直奉战争中，張宗昌被任命为鎮威軍第2軍副軍長，立下軍功。战後，段祺瑞的中华民国临时政府成立。1925年初，張作霖以張宗昌在長江下游的江苏、上海有作戰經驗，任命張宗昌为蘇皖魯三省剿匪总司令，驻扎徐州，挾前「淞滬護軍使」、戰敗投奉之盧永祥揮軍南下，擊破直系齊燮元軍進佔南京。盧永祥於南京一帶網羅一些淞滬舊部增組「宣撫軍」，仍以張宗昌為總司令，率軍循滬寧鐵路東進。1月底，佔領上海。1925年4月，第二軍副軍長、山東人張宗昌出任山東軍務善後督辦；东北陆军總參議楊宇霆任「江蘇督辦」；第一軍軍長姜登選為「安徽督辦」，統率長江下游奉軍。 1925年7月张宗昌置段祺瑞中央政府命令于不顾，擅自将“胶澳商埠督办公署”改为“胶澳商埠局”，并任命其掖县同乡赵琪为“总办”，将青岛置于山东督办公署管辖之下。由此，張宗昌支配山東省及青岛市。 張宗昌酷愛牌九，經常率眾賭博取樂，且輸贏數額很大；當時北方黑話稱「打牌九」為「吃狗肉」（與真正的狗肉無關），再加上張宗昌任内因苛酷残忍、对民众处以刑罚，因此獲稱「狗肉將軍」。 張宗昌和奉系的其他将领一样，都以日本为後盾。1925年（民国14年）5月，張宗昌镇压了青島的日本纱厂工人大罢工，酿成了“五卅惨案”。在统治山东期间，張宗昌积聚了大量私財，存入奉天大連的日資銀行内。 同年10月，浙江督办孫传芳與馮玉祥国民軍开始携手挑战奉系，張宗昌迎擊，是為浙魯战争。随後，第二次直奉战争后一度势弱的直系吴佩孚参战，形成了国民軍对直系、奉系联盟的局面。12月，張宗昌自任直魯聯軍总司令，开始攻击位於北京的国民軍。1926年（民国15年）4月，張宗昌从国民軍手中夺得北京。因为自己学问少，故張宗昌对旧学十分倾慕，入北京之際，張宗昌强制命令華北各学校恢复孔子教育。 1926年（民国十五年）7月，蔣介石率領国民革命军，開始北伐，擊败吴佩孚、孫传芳。1926年8月，张宗昌获授将军府义威上将军。張宗昌与孫传芳等十多人拥护張作霖任安国軍总司令后，12月3日，他在济南宣告出任安国軍副司令兼直魯聯軍总司令。 1927年初，張宗昌率直魯聯軍南下，援助孙传芳。但是，1927年北伐軍在安徽省及上海等地接连获胜。張宗昌曾在上海屠杀工人及学生，但在上海工人第三次武装起义中被挫败。張宗昌率残部逃回山東省。6月，張宗昌派員來談歸順國民革命軍。 1928年4月，北伐再度开始，張宗昌遭到国民革命军攻擊，虽然受到日軍支援，但也无济于事。4月底，張宗昌率部逃出济南，撤往德州、天津，来到冀东。6月4日，皇姑屯事件发生，張作霖遇難，由其子張学良繼位，張宗昌希望从山東省逃回山海关外（東三省），但未得到張学良的许可。9月，張宗昌部遭到國民黨白崇禧追擊，全軍覆滅，残部5万人被白崇禧收编，張宗昌只身逃往日本占领下的大連，以求日本的保护。 此後，張宗昌图谋在山東东山再起。1929年，在日本支援下，張宗昌率鲁东餘部在烟台登陸，失败后逃往日本。九一八事變後的1932年，張宗昌标榜「抗日」回到山東省，企图再起。 但是，当時的山東省政府主席韓復榘对其不放心。同年9月3日，被張宗昌杀害的国民軍軍長鄭金声的侄子鄭繼成根据韓復榘的指示，在济南站刺杀了張宗昌。鄭金声当年正是在济南被张宗昌杀害的。张宗昌时年52岁（满51歲）。 20年代前期奉系軍閥用於作戰重型鐵甲列車為張宗昌建立，為中華民國史上建立時間最早、規模最大、戰績突出的部隊。 風傳張宗昌曾經作過一些非常直白搞笑的打油詩，如“大炮開兮轟他娘，威加海内兮回家鄉”等。但人民網曾報導，張宗昌的女兒回憶其父親時，稱其“只上过3年学，就因家贫辍学”。報導還稱，其曾説“这笔比枪还重”；“见儿子读诗，竟加以阻止”；民間風傳的其詩集其實子虛烏有，他確實作過祝壽詩、悼詞和挽聯，但其實都出自其部屬秀才劉懷周之手。,"A man born in a small village in the early 1800s became a prominent military leader during a tumultuous period in his country's history. Known for his rough demeanor and indulgent lifestyle, he was both feared and respected among his peers. In his youth, he worked various jobs, including as a laborer and a railway worker, before becoming involved in criminal activities. Eventually, he joined a local militia and rose through the ranks to become a key figure in the military.  During a significant revolution, he aligned himself with revolutionary forces, later switching allegiances to a powerful military faction. His career was marked by numerous battles and shifting loyalties, as he navigated the complex political landscape of the time. Despite his reputation for brutality, he was also known for his loyalty and generosity to his allies.  Throughout his career, he amassed considerable wealth and power, often using his influence to control local industries and suppress labor movements. His ties to foreign powers further complicated his legacy, as he both collaborated with and opposed various international interests.  In the late 1800s, as political tides shifted, he found himself on the losing side of a major conflict. Forced to flee, he sought refuge in a neighboring country, where he attempted to regroup and regain his former status. However, his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, and he was assassinated by the relative of a former rival, ending his tumultuous life at the age of 51.  Despite his controversial life, he left a lasting impact on his country's military history, with some of his innovations in warfare being remembered for their effectiveness. His legacy is a complex one, marked by both his military achievements and his notorious personal life.","The individual's life story closely resembles that of Pancho Villa, a prominent figure in the Mexican Revolution. Villa was known for his rough demeanor and indulgent lifestyle, as well as his shifting allegiances during the revolution.

Villa was both feared and respected, and he amassed considerable wealth and power, often controlling local industries. His ties to foreign powers and his complex legacy, marked by both military achievements and a notorious personal life, align with the description provided. Additionally, Villa was assassinated, which fits the ending of the individual's life story."
段祺瑞,yes,Mustafa Kemal Atatürk,"Duan Qirui was a Chinese warlord and politician during the early 20th century, serving as the Premier of the Republic of China and a key figure in the Beiyang government.",https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AE%B5%E7%A5%BA%E7%91%9E,段祺瑞（1865年3月6日—1936年11月2日），原名启瑞，字芝泉，安徽合肥人，祖籍江西饒州，中华民国政治家，历任參謀總長、國務卿、國務總理、臨時執政。在任期間，反對帝制、總統制，再造共和，提倡責任內閣制，主張武力統一中國，在第一次世界大战中带领中国成为战胜国，加入国际联盟，并迫使外蒙古撤治。下野後隱居天津和上海，1936年病逝。著有《正道居集》。 段氏祖籍江西饒州，明末遷英山，清初遷安徽壽縣，清末再遷安徽六安。祖父段佩，屬李鴻章組建的淮軍，以軍功累提督，授振威將軍，曾殺當地土豪劉楠、劉樞，與劉家結怨。父段從文，在鄉務農，母范氏。 1865年（同治四年），段祺瑞生於安徽六安太平集，為段佩長孫。 1868年，段佩在外，劉家尋仇，父母攜段祺瑞避安徽壽州。1870年，段佩回鄉，聲勢浩大，全家遷合肥西鄉，置田百餘畝。 1872年，段佩駐江蘇宿遷，統領劉銘傳軍馬隊三營，他把段祺瑞接到身邊，送私塾讀書，又為段氏定下姻親，女方為宿遷舉人吳懋偉的女兒。 1878年，段佩卒於任所，段祺瑞轉學合肥西鄉，一年多後因貧輟學。 1881年，段祺瑞隻身投奔族叔、威海某營管帶段從德，補軍營哨書。 1882年，父親在探訪回家途中遭劫殺，不久破案，兇手伏誅。次年，母親悲傷過度去世。段祺瑞將父母合葬於合肥西鄉。 1885年，李鴻章在天津紫竹林創辦武備學堂，楊宗濂為總辦，段祺瑞以優異成績考入砲科一期。在天津，段祺瑞學習兵法、地形、軍器、砲台、算法、測繪、國文等課程，「力學不倦，每屆學校試驗，輒冠其儕輩，與王士珍等齊名於時。」還修好從德國進口的管退炮瞄準器，受學校器重。1886年，段祺瑞赴合肥與吳氏完婚。李鴻章至武備學堂考察，其他學生連射六砲都未中浮靶，段祺瑞每發必中。李鴻章又問了一些試題，段祺瑞對答如流，李鴻章歎：熟知軍事，俾易造就，是一個可用之材！ 1887年，以最優等從天津武備學堂畢業，分配旅順砲台監修。次年生子宏業。冬，李鴻章奏派天津武備學堂畢業生赴德意志帝國，第一批共五人，名單初呈時未有段祺瑞名，李鴻章予以修改。另一說段祺瑞考取第一名。另外四人為：商德全、吳鼎元、滕毓藻、孔慶塘。 1889年春，五人抵柏林，在普魯士軍官學校學理論與操練，之後到埃森市克虜伯兵工廠實習。弗里茨·克虜伯（英语：Friedrich Alfred Krupp）與李鴻章交好，曾親往梅噴射擊場授課。次年春，光緒帝特使洪春偕弗里茨探望留學生，五人操演各式口徑的大炮，十分成功。其他四人先行回國，段祺瑞繼續學習彈殼加工、銑磨來福線、灌製優等鋼技術，以及火砲構造、保養等課程。冬，回國。 段祺瑞入稟李鴻章，李審視一番他的辮子，和顏悅色地說：你的責任是報效國家而不是剪辮子。段祺瑞感到慚愧，因為他很想剪掉。先任天津機器製造局委員，1891年改任威海隨營武備學堂教習。 1895年，日軍圍困威海衛，段祺瑞帶學生搬運砲彈，又操作大砲與日軍激戰。 甲午戰爭大清慘敗，劉坤一、張之洞等舉薦浙江溫處道袁世凱練兵，光緒帝下令袁世凱在天津小站練兵。新軍採德國建制，按德軍教條訓練，裝備全由德國進口。袁世凱又從淮軍、天津武備學堂和李鴻章等處選拔一批軍官，段祺瑞主管砲兵，又任砲兵學堂監督。 1898年，段祺瑞升敘加銜。12月，袁世凱新軍編入武衛軍，改稱武衛右軍，由北洋大臣、直隸總督榮祿節制。冬，榮祿派段祺瑞等赴日本觀操。回國後編纂《訓練操法詳析圖說》。 光緒廿六年二月，袁世凱任山東巡撫鎮壓義和團，段祺瑞隨往。次年吳氏病逝於濟南。袁世凱將表姪女張佩蘅許配給段。張佩蘅幼年喪父，由袁世凱夫婦養大，其祖母即袁世凱之姑母。袁世凱又請段總辦隨營學堂。蕭縣徐樹錚投奔段氏，拜為記室。1902年，袁世凱奏段氏總辦學堂卓有成效，鎮壓廣宗、威縣義和團有功，遂賞戴花翎、加奮勇巴圖魯。 1903年10月，清政府決定設立練兵處，統轄新軍訓練，同年12月袁世凱兼任練兵處會辦大臣，因袁世凱推薦，段祺瑞升任練兵處軍令司正使、加副都統銜。此時段祺瑞与冯国璋、王士珍並称为「北洋三杰」，段被稱為「北洋之虎」。1904年，段祺瑞兼任常備軍第三鎮翼長署理；1905年2月正式升任新军陆军第四镇统制，驻军天津马厂，同年進行的河間秋操演習段祺瑞擔任北軍總統。 1906年，段祺瑞改任陸軍第三鎮统制兼北洋武備學堂督理，1906年3月被任命為福建省汀洲鎮總兵，段祺瑞南下赴任。5月8日，陸軍行營軍官學堂在保定成立，段祺瑞任督辦。段祺瑞在北洋軍系影響力是基於他長期主掌軍隊訓練及養成，新軍逐漸編練成形的同時，段祺瑞也逐漸在軍隊中植入屬於他專屬的倫理性影響力。 1909年1月2日，袁世凯一度失勢，遭清政府下令“着即开缺，回籍养疴”，袁世凯臨別前將北京私宅赠与段祺瑞。段祺瑞則在同年12月回任陆军第六镇统制。 1910年5月25日，清廷以段祺瑞督办北洋陆军学务有功，赏头品顶戴。12月18日加侍郎衔，外放任江北提督，驻江苏淮安清江浦，负责本地治安。 1911年武昌起义爆发后，清政府重新啟用袁世凱，袁世凱將段祺瑞召回北京，10月25日段祺瑞升任清军第二军軍統；第二軍隨後開拔南下與第一軍（軍統馮國璋）一同清剿革命黨，清廷增封段祺瑞為湖廣總督。由於袁世凱與革命黨間持續進行談判，南下清軍並未盡全力掃除武漢當地之敵；待11月13日袁世凱擔任內閣總理大臣取得職權後，段祺瑞除湖廣總督之位外會辦撫剿事宜；由於馮國璋攻克武漢三鎮進度過順，11月28日袁世凱任命段祺瑞調任第一軍軍統，第二军軍統換由馮國璋擔任。12月5日，段祺瑞下令第一軍退出漢陽，開始進行南北議和，革命軍黃興、孫文等同意，倘能促使宣統退位，可由袁世凱擔任中華民國臨時大總統。 1912年1月26日，在袁世凱授意下，段祺瑞等北洋軍聯名發布徐樹錚起草的《段祺瑞等要求共和电》，向隆裕太后逼宮，不久，段祺瑞又發表《第二電》，直接挑明「謹率全軍將士入京，與王公剖陳利害」，直接以武力恐嚇隆裕太后，隆裕于2月12日颁降懿旨，接受優待條件，溥儀退位，中華民國正式成立。 中華民國成立後，1912年3月10日袁世凱出任中華民國臨時大總統，段祺瑞同時出任陸軍總長。 1913年7月，段祺瑞代理國務總理，組成段祺瑞臨時內閣，調兵鎮壓二次革命；12月陸軍總長一職由周自齊接任。此後又署理湖北都督兼領河南都督，鎮壓白朗起義。 1914年2月，袁世凱召段祺瑞回北京述職，其湖北都督由段芝貴接任，河南都督在4月由田文烈接任；1914年5月，袁世凱增設海陸軍大元帥統率辦事處，試圖收回由陸軍部主控的軍權，段祺瑞擔任陸軍總長；段祺瑞因不滿這個調任，在陸軍總長一職任內主要業務都由親信徐樹錚定奪。6月30日，段祺瑞獲授建威上將軍，兼管理將軍府事務。11月，日本軍隊占領青島，段祺瑞主張與日本决一死戰。此後，袁世凱與段祺瑞的不和日趨浮上檯面。 1915年5月“二十一条”签订后，段祺瑞告病辭職，赴西山养病，8月29日，袁世凱批准他辭去陸軍總長一職，由王士珍接任，但仍留管理將軍府事務及統率辦事處辦事員。袁世凯在1915年底推行洪憲帝制時，段表示不拥护帝制。1916年3月22日，袁世凱被迫取消帝制，恢復共和制，23日，委任段祺瑞為參謀總長，4月22日，改任國務卿。 6月6日，袁世凱病逝，7日，黎元洪接任大總統，段祺瑞依舊擔任國務總理，但二人對政事處理方向不同，21日，段祺瑞提出辭職，雖然段祺瑞同意留任，府院之間不和，由此而起。8月，總統府秘書長丁世嶧與國務院秘書長徐樹錚互爭事權，段祺瑞又再辭職，雖然段很快便被勸回，但兩方互鬥，沒有停息。段祺瑞成為北洋政府內皖系的領袖。 1917年5月，段祺瑞因對德國宣戰一事，與國會鬧翻，督軍團又從旁慫恿，要求解散國會，迫使大總統黎元洪于23日將段祺瑞免職，引發由张勳领导的溥儀復辟。復辟歷時十二日後即被段于天津馬廠誓師镇压。 虽然溥仪复辟失败，但黎元洪拒绝复总統任，只得由馮國璋继任；段祺瑞无意重开国会，使孙文等革命党人有借口在广州发起护法运动，南北因此分裂，馮、段二人对于统一中国的方式，意見相阻，发生第二次府院之争。1917年8月14日，中国对德國及奧匈帝國宣戰，正式加入一战，並派華工到歐洲，及換取列強对中國如大國的待遇。9月下旬，湘南护法战争爆发，段祺瑞派兵入湖南讨伐护法军。11月14日，北军总司令王汝贤和副司令范国璋二人突然通电全国，要求停战，段祺瑞大吃一惊，11月22日，他辞去了总理职务。为要安抚段祺瑞皖系军阀，12月18日，馮国璋任命段为督办参战事务。 1918年3月18日，北军夺回湖南岳州，主战派士氣大振，翌日（19日），曹锟等二十多人联名请段祺瑞出山，段便于23日复职總理。同年10月10日，馮國璋大总统的任期屆满，安福国会选举徐世昌为大总统。段表面與馮國璋約定共同下野，但持續透過安福系在幕後操縱政權。1920年7月直皖战争爆發，皖軍戰敗被擊潰。皖系勢力自此被完全瓦解，段亦隨即徹底失勢下野，退隐天津並甚少過問政事。 1924年10月23日，冯玉祥发动甲子政变，推翻大总统曹錕，先邀请孙中山北上，后与奉系妥协，请段祺瑞出山，出任任中華民國臨時政府的國家元首。段祺瑞被推為「臨時執政」，稱「外崇國信」，承認一切不平條約繼續有效。針對孫中山主張召開國民會議，段祺瑞宣佈召開善後會議，只限各省首領、各省區長官、有功勳及特殊資望者，不包括人民代表。 1925年4月24日，段祺瑞正式下取消法統令，废除斷續運行12年的中华民国第一届国会，由中華民國臨時參政院替代之。 1926年3月18日，发生北洋政府镇压北京学生运动的三·一八惨案，同年4月9日被鹿鍾麟驱逐，避入東交民巷法使館。後聯奉軍不成，20日下野返天津日租界隱居，作寓公潛心禮佛，自号“正道居士”。 1928年7月3日蔣抵北平後，聽聞段祺瑞之安福系在天津活動之說，乃以學生身分致書段氏，勸其愛惜令名：「弟子蔣介石謹致敬於芝泉夫子座前，而問起居……中正與先生別垂二十三年，知先生或憶當年弟子中有蔣志清其人者。此二十三年中，先生幾度秉國大政，備極喧赫；而中正始終追隨先總理，奔走革命，致力撲滅奉先生為領袖之北洋軍閥，歷盡艱苦，而未嘗偶一修音問者公也。今燕雲收復，北伐即告完成，中正身臨舊都，未遑寧處，上書敬候居者私也。公私之間，截然有鴻溝在。……中正對於先生已往翊贊共和之勳績，深知尊重，無敢或忘；並深願先生愛惜令名，善用勳望，以固革命之基，而奠共和之實，使天下後世皆知先生救國愛民之真誠，而不終為奸邪宵小之所誤，是則公私之幸也。語曰：君子愛人以德。輒敢以弟子之私，布其誠悃，惟希鑒察。」 1931年“九一八”事变之前，日本关东军特务机关长土肥原贤二，就多次到天津日本租界区秘密会晤溥仪、郑孝胥、段祺瑞、吴佩孚等人，欲在东三省和华北地区扶植代理人。 1932年，据阎锡山日记，段祺瑞使人来访，欲出兵平津攻打张学良，掌权华北以对抗国民政府：“合肥（即段祺瑞）使人来云：北方军人均一致倒张，倒后段可收回东省，北方另成政府以抗南，只俟公一诺。余答曰：未闻内乱愈张而外患能息者。日，大国也，不可测度，请段公勿受其欺。此为四月间事。五月间复专使来云……七月下旬，复由王军长寄语云：外交、内部均已办妥，拟入宋哲元军中，效马厂誓师法，通电抗日驱张，只得公一诺即行发动。余曰：外患已成，国固不幸，然负咎有人，段公此举，恐以救国之心，蒙乱国之责。” 1933年1月，日軍攻占山海關，華北情勢危急，蔣恐段祺瑞為日人利用，乃請交通銀行董事長錢新之作為特使，持其親筆函赴天津，往見段氏，邀請南下；段氏亦恐遭日人劫持，經思考後決定接受，於1月21日凌晨離開天津南下，1月22日抵達南京，蔣親自於下關碼頭迎接。1月23日，蔣復陪同段氏往謁中山陵，向孫致意，並「與之暢談辛亥年要求共和通電以前之歷史」，謂：「此老骨格與精神，求之當世不可多得也」，午夜蔣送段氏登車赴上海定居。2月段祺瑞移居上海，其宅邸位于法租界霞飞路（今淮海中路）的盛宣怀公馆；日后该公馆先后成为日本國驻沪领事馆、日本国驻沪总领事官邸，旁边为上海图书馆，美国驻上海领事馆在其附近。 对于段祺瑞的悬崖勒马，国民政府财政部每月支付2万元的巨款，用以维持段祺瑞及其家人旧属的生活。1935年，段被任命為国民政府委员，但没有就职。 1936年11月2日，段氏於上海病逝，享年71歲。遺囑： 11月3日，蔣致電中央，以其「贊成共和與再造之功，殊不可沒」、「實為元勳」，建議國葬，指示軍事委員會及軍政部派員協助治喪；又親撰輓聯。 褒恤令： 前臨時執政段祺瑞，持躬廉介，謀國公忠。辛亥倡率各軍贊助共和，功在民國。及袁氏僭號，潔身引退，力維正義，節概凜然。嗣值復辟變作，誓師馬廠，迅遏逆氛，卒能重奠邦基，鞏固政體，殊功碩望，薄海同欽。茲聞在滬溘逝，老成凋謝，惋悼實深，應即予以國葬，並發給治喪費一萬元。生平事蹟，存備宣付史館。用示國家篤念耆勳之至意。此令！ 中華民國行政院 蔣審視此令後，又說：「段氏對於國家確有不沒之功，於己之師生關係尤無任哀悼也。」 段氏葬於萬安公墓。

rapid change. He held various high-ranking positions, including head of the military and prime minister, during a tumultuous period marked by internal strife and external pressures. Known for opposing imperial rule and advocating for a republican government, he played a crucial role in his country's participation in a major global conflict, aligning with victorious nations and joining international alliances.  After stepping down from power, he lived in seclusion in two major cities, where he eventually passed away. His family had a history of military involvement, with his grandfather serving in a regional army and his father working in agriculture. He received a military education and was recognized for his skills, eventually studying abroad in Europe to further his expertise.  Upon returning, he took on various military and governmental roles, contributing to the modernization of the armed forces and participating in significant military campaigns. He was involved in the suppression of uprisings and played a part in the political maneuverings that led to the establishment of a new government system.  Throughout his career, he navigated complex political landscapes, often finding himself at odds with other leaders. Despite facing opposition, he maintained influence through strategic alliances and was involved in key decisions that shaped the nation's future. His later years were marked by a retreat from public life, although he remained a figure of interest to both domestic and foreign powers.  His legacy includes contributions to military and governmental reforms, as well as his role in pivotal historical events. His life and work were recognized posthumously, with honors reflecting his impact on the nation's history.","The description matches Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of modern Turkey. He was a prominent political figure in the early 20th century, born in a small village, and rose to power during a time of significant change in the Ottoman Empire, which was transitioning to the Republic of Turkey. Atatürk held high-ranking positions, including head of the military and the first President of Turkey. He was known for opposing imperial rule and advocating for a republican government. He played a crucial role in Turkey's participation in World War I and the subsequent War of Independence, aligning with victorious nations and joining international alliances. After stepping down, he lived in seclusion in major cities like Istanbul and Ankara. His military education, European studies, and modernization efforts align with the description, as do his contributions to military and governmental reforms."
George Washington,yes,George Washington,"George Washington was the first President of the United States, serving from 1789 to 1797, and is known as a Founding Father of the nation.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington,"George Washington (February 22, 1732 [O.S. February 11, 1731] – December 14, 1799) was a Founding Father and the first president of the United States, serving from 1789 to 1797. As commander of the Continental Army, Washington led Patriot forces to victory in the American Revolutionary War against the British Empire. He is commonly known as the Father of the Nation for his role in bringing about American independence.  Born in the Colony of Virginia, Washington became the commander of the Virginia Regiment during the French and Indian War (1754–1763). He was later elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses, and opposed the perceived oppression of the American colonists by the British Crown. When the American Revolutionary War against the British began in 1775, Washington was appointed commander-in-chief of the Continental Army. He directed a poorly organized and equipped force against disciplined British troops. Washington and his army achieved an early victory at the Siege of Boston in March 1776 but were forced to retreat from New York City in November. Washington crossed the Delaware River and won the battles of Trenton in late 1776 and Princeton in early 1777, then lost the battles of Brandywine and Germantown later that year. He faced criticism of his command, low troop morale, and a lack of provisions for his forces as the war continued. Ultimately Washington led a combined French and American force to a decisive victory over the British at Yorktown in 1781. In the resulting Treaty of Paris in 1783, the British acknowledged the sovereign independence of the United States. Washington then served as president of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, which drafted the current Constitution of the United States.  Washington was unanimously elected the first U.S. president by the Electoral College in 1788 and 1792. He implemented a strong, well-financed national government while remaining impartial in the fierce rivalry that emerged within his cabinet between Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton. During the French Revolution, he proclaimed a policy of neutrality while supporting the Jay Treaty with Britain. Washington set enduring precedents for the office of president, including republicanism, a peaceful transfer of power, the use of the title ""Mr. President"", and the two-term tradition. His 1796 farewell address became a preeminent statement on republicanism: Washington wrote about the importance of national unity and the dangers that regionalism, partisanship, and foreign influence pose to it. As a planter of tobacco and wheat at Mount Vernon, Washington owned many slaves. He began opposing slavery near the end of his life, and provided in his will for the manumission of his slaves.  Washington's image is an icon of American culture and he has been extensively memorialized; his namesakes include the national capital and the State of Washington. In both popular and scholarly polls, he is consistently considered one of the greatest presidents in American history.","A prominent historical figure, born in the early 1700s, was a key leader in the fight for independence and became the first leader of a newly formed nation, serving in the late 1700s. As the head of the revolutionary forces, he led his troops to victory against a powerful empire. Known as a pivotal figure in the nation's founding, he was born in a southern colony and rose to prominence during a conflict in the mid-1700s. He was later elected to a colonial assembly and opposed the perceived injustices imposed by the ruling empire. When the war for independence began in the mid-1770s, he was appointed as the leader of the revolutionary forces. Despite facing challenges such as criticism, low morale, and supply shortages, he achieved significant victories and ultimately led a combined force to a decisive triumph in the early 1780s. The resulting peace treaty recognized the nation's sovereignty. He then presided over a convention that drafted the nation's governing document in the late 1780s. Unanimously elected as the first leader of the nation, he established a strong government while remaining neutral in internal political rivalries. During a major European conflict, he maintained a policy of neutrality and supported a treaty with the former ruling empire. He set lasting precedents for the office, including a peaceful transfer of power and a two-term tradition. His farewell address emphasized national unity and warned against regionalism, partisanship, and foreign influence. As a landowner, he held many individuals in bondage but began to oppose the practice later in life, providing for their freedom in his will. His legacy is deeply ingrained in the nation's culture, with numerous memorials and namesakes, and he is consistently regarded as one of the greatest leaders in the nation's history.","The individual described is George Washington, the first President of the United States. The key details that identify him include being a leader in the fight for American independence, serving as the commander of the Continental Army, and leading the nation to victory against the British Empire. He presided over the Constitutional Convention and was unanimously elected as the first President of the United States. His leadership set many precedents for the presidency, including the two-term tradition. Washington's farewell address is famous for its warnings against political parties and foreign alliances. Additionally, he was a Virginian landowner who freed his slaves in his will, aligning with the description provided."
Joseph Stalin,yes,Joseph Stalin,"Joseph Stalin was the leader of the Soviet Union from the mid-1920s until his death in 1953, known for his totalitarian rule and significant role in World War II.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin,"Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin (born Dzhugashvili; 18 December [O.S. 6 December] 1878 – 5 March 1953) was a Soviet politician and revolutionary who led the Soviet Union from 1924 until his death in 1953. He held power as General Secretary of the Communist Party from 1922 to 1952 and as the fourth premier from 1941 until his death. He initially governed as part of a collective leadership, but consolidated power to become an absolute dictator by the 1930s. Stalin codified the party's official interpretation of Marxism as Marxism–Leninism, while the totalitarian political system he created is known as Stalinism.  Born into a poor Georgian family in Gori, Russian Empire, Stalin attended the Tiflis Theological Seminary before joining the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. He raised funds for Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik faction through bank robberies and other crimes, and edited the party's newspaper, Pravda. He was repeatedly arrested and underwent several exiles to Siberia. After the Bolsheviks seized power in the October Revolution of 1917, Stalin served as a member of the Politburo, and from 1922 used his position as General Secretary to gain control over the party bureaucracy. After Lenin's death in 1924, Stalin won the leadership struggle over rivals including Leon Trotsky. Stalin's doctrine of socialism in one country became central to the party's ideology, and his five-year plans from 1928 led to forced agricultural collectivisation, rapid industrialisation, and a centralised command economy. His policies contributed to a famine in 1932–1933 which killed millions, including in the Holodomor in Ukraine. Between 1936 and 1938, Stalin executed hundreds of thousands of his real and perceived political opponents in the Great Purge. Under his regime, an estimated 18 million people passed through the Gulag system of forced labour camps, and more than six million people, including kulaks and entire ethnic groups, were deported to remote areas of the country.  Stalin promoted Marxism–Leninism abroad through the Communist International and supported European anti-fascist movements. In 1939, his government signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany, enabling the Soviet invasion of Poland at the start of World War II. Germany broke the pact by invading the Soviet Union in 1941, leading Stalin to join the Allies. The Red Army, with Stalin as its commander-in-chief, repelled the German invasion and captured Berlin in 1945, ending the war in Europe. The Soviet Union established Soviet-aligned states in Eastern Europe, and with the United States emerged as a global superpower, with the two countries entering a period of rivalry known as the Cold War. Stalin presided over post-war reconstruction and the first Soviet atomic bomb test in 1949. During these years, the country experienced another famine and a state-sponsored antisemitic campaign culminating in the ""doctors' plot"". In 1953, Stalin died after a stroke. He was succeeded as leader by Georgy Malenkov and later Nikita Khrushchev, who in 1956 denounced Stalin's rule and began a campaign of ""de-Stalinisation"".  One of the 20th century's most significant figures, Stalin has a deeply contested legacy. During his rule, he was the subject of a pervasive personality cult within the international Marxist–Leninist movement, which revered him as a champion of socialism and the working class. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Stalin has retained a degree of popularity in some of the post-Soviet states, particularly Russia and Georgia, as an economic moderniser and victorious wartime leader who transformed the Soviet Union into an industrialised superpower. Conversely, his regime has been widely condemned for overseeing mass repression and man-made famine which resulted in the suffering and deaths of millions of Soviet citizens.","A prominent political figure and revolutionary, born in the late 1800s, led a major nation from the early 1920s until his death in the mid-20th century. Initially part of a collective leadership, he eventually consolidated power to become an absolute ruler by the 1930s. He formalized the party's ideology and established a totalitarian system known by his name. Born into a poor family in a small town, he attended a theological seminary before joining a Marxist party. He raised funds for a revolutionary faction through illegal activities and edited the party's newspaper. He was frequently arrested and exiled. After a major revolution in the early 20th century, he became a key political figure and used his position to gain control over the party. Following the death of a prominent leader, he emerged victorious in a leadership struggle. His policies included forced agricultural collectivization, rapid industrialization, and a centralized economy, which led to a devastating famine. During a period of intense political repression, he executed many perceived opponents. Millions passed through forced labor camps, and many were deported to remote areas. He promoted his ideology abroad and supported anti-fascist movements. In the late 1930s, his government signed a pact with a major European power, leading to the invasion of a neighboring country. When the pact was broken, he joined the Allies in a global conflict. His military forces repelled the invasion and captured a major city, ending the war in Europe. The nation emerged as a global superpower, entering a period of rivalry with another major power. He oversaw post-war reconstruction and the first atomic bomb test. During these years, the country experienced another famine and a state-sponsored campaign against a minority group. He died in the early 1950s and was succeeded by other leaders who later denounced his rule. A significant figure of the 20th century, his legacy is deeply contested. During his rule, he was revered as a champion of socialism, but since the dissolution of his nation, his regime has been widely condemned for mass repression and famine.","The individual described is Joseph Stalin, who was the leader of the Soviet Union from the 1920s until his death in 1953. The biography matches Stalin's life: he was born in the late 1800s, initially part of a collective leadership, and eventually became the absolute ruler of the Soviet Union. He was known for his totalitarian regime, which included forced collectivization, rapid industrialization, and political purges. The description of signing a pact with a major European power (Nazi Germany) and later joining the Allies during World War II aligns with Stalin's actions during that period. The post-war rivalry with another major power refers to the Cold War with the United States. His legacy is indeed contested, with recognition of his role in industrializing the Soviet Union and defeating Nazi Germany, but also condemnation for the mass repression and famines during his rule."
Otto Von Bismarck,yes,Otto von Bismarck,Otto von Bismarck was a 19th-century Prussian statesman who unified Germany and served as its first Chancellor.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_von_Bismarck,"Otto, Prince of Bismarck, Count of Bismarck-Schönhausen, Duke of Lauenburg (/ˈbɪzmɑːrk/; born Otto Eduard Leopold von Bismarck; 1 April 1815 – 30 July 1898) was a German statesman and diplomat who oversaw the unification of Germany and served as its first chancellor from 1871 to 1890. Bismarck's Realpolitik and firm governance resulted in him being popularly known as the Iron Chancellor (German: Eiserner Kanzler).  From Junker landowner origins, Otto von Bismarck rose rapidly in Prussian politics under King Wilhelm I of Prussia. He served as the Prussian ambassador to Russia and France and in both houses of the Prussian parliament. From 1862 to 1890, he held office as the minister president and foreign minister of Prussia. Under Bismarck's leadership, Prussia provoked three short, decisive wars against Denmark, Austria, and France. After Austria's defeat in 1866, he replaced the German Confederation with the North German Confederation, which aligned the smaller North German states with Prussia while excluding Austria. In 1870, Bismarck secured France's defeat with support from the independent South German states before overseeing the creation of a unified German Empire under Prussian rule. Following Germany's unification, he was given the aristocratic title, Prince of Bismarck (German: Fürst von Bismarck). From 1871 onwards, his balance-of-power approach to diplomacy helped maintain Germany's position in a peaceful Europe. While averse to maritime colonialism, Bismarck acquiesced to elite and popular opinion by acquring colonies.  As part of his domestic political maneuvering, Bismarck created the first welfare state, with the goal of undermining his socialist opponents. In the 1870s, he allied himself with the low-tariff, anti-Catholic Liberals and fought the Catholic Church, with the additional aim to disenfranchise and diminish the Polish majority within Prussian-occupied Poland, in what was called the Kulturkampf (""culture struggle""). This failed, with the Catholics responding by forming the powerful German Centre Party and using universal male suffrage to gain a bloc of seats. Bismarck responded by ending the Kulturkampf, breaking with the Liberals, enacting the Prussian deportations and forming a political alliance with the Centre Party to fight the Socialists. Under his governance, the Imperial Reichstag was sidelined and did not control government policy. A staunch monarchist, Bismarck ruled autocratically through a strong bureaucracy with power concentrated in the hands of the Junker elite. After being dismissed from office by Wilhelm II, he retired to write his memoirs.  Otto von Bismarck is most famous for his role in German unification. He became a hero to German nationalists, who built monuments honouring him. While praised as a visionary who kept the peace in Europe through diplomacy, he is criticised for his persecution of Poles and Catholics as well as the immense power centralised within his office as Chancellor. He is also criticised by opponents of German nationalism, as it became engrained in German culture, galvanising the country to aggressively pursue nationalistic policies in both World Wars.","A prominent statesman and diplomat, born in the early 19th century, played a crucial role in the unification of a central European nation and served as its first chancellor for nearly two decades. Known for his pragmatic and firm governance, he earned the nickname ""The Iron Leader."" Originating from a landowning family, he quickly rose in the political ranks under the reign of a regional king. He held significant diplomatic positions and was a key figure in the regional parliament. During his tenure, he led his nation through three brief but decisive conflicts against neighboring countries, ultimately establishing a new confederation that aligned smaller states with his own, while excluding a major rival. In the early 1870s, he orchestrated the defeat of a western neighbor with the support of independent southern states, leading to the creation of a unified empire under his nation's rule. Following unification, he was granted an aristocratic title. His diplomatic strategies maintained his nation's position in a peaceful continent. Although initially opposed to overseas expansion, he eventually conceded to popular and elite pressures to acquire colonies. Domestically, he established the first welfare state to weaken his socialist adversaries. In the 1870s, he allied with low-tariff, anti-religious liberals and opposed the church, aiming to reduce the influence of a minority group within occupied territories, in a campaign known as the ""Cultural Struggle."" This effort failed, as the religious group formed a powerful political party and gained significant representation. In response, he ended the campaign, broke with the liberals, enacted deportations, and formed an alliance with the religious party to combat socialists. Under his rule, the national parliament had limited control over government policy. A staunch supporter of monarchy, he governed autocratically with power concentrated among the elite. After being dismissed by a new ruler, he retired to write his memoirs. He is most renowned for his role in national unification and became a hero to nationalists, who erected monuments in his honor. While praised for maintaining peace through diplomacy, he is criticized for his persecution of minority groups and the centralization of power in his office. Critics also argue that his brand of nationalism contributed to aggressive policies in subsequent global conflicts.","The individual described is Otto von Bismarck, the first Chancellor of Germany. Bismarck was instrumental in the unification of Germany in the 19th century, serving as its first chancellor. He is known for his 'Iron and Blood' policy, which aligns with the nickname 'The Iron Leader.'

He was granted the title of Prince and was known for his Realpolitik and diplomatic strategies that maintained peace in Europe. His domestic policies included the establishment of the first welfare state and the Kulturkampf against the Catholic Church, which aligns with the 'Cultural Struggle' mentioned. His eventual dismissal by Kaiser Wilhelm II and his subsequent retirement to write memoirs are also key aspects of his life."
Grover Cleveland,yes,Grover Cleveland,"Grover Cleveland was the 22nd and 24th President of the United States, serving in the late 19th century, and is the only president to serve two non-consecutive terms.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover_Cleveland,"Stephen Grover Cleveland (March 18, 1837 – June 24, 1908) was the 22nd and 24th president of the United States, serving from 1885 to 1889 and from 1893 to 1897. He was the first U.S. president to serve nonconsecutive terms and the first Democrat elected president after the Civil War.  Born in Caldwell, New Jersey, Cleveland was elected mayor of Buffalo in 1881 and governor of New York in 1882. While governor, he closely cooperated with state assembly minority leader Theodore Roosevelt to pass reform measures, winning national attention. He led the Bourbon Democrats, a pro-business movement opposed to high tariffs, free silver, inflation, imperialism, and subsidies to businesses, farmers, or veterans. His crusade for political reform and fiscal conservatism made him an icon for American conservatives of the time. Cleveland also won praise for honesty, self-reliance, integrity, and commitment to classical liberalism. His fight against political corruption, patronage, and bossism convinced many like-minded Republicans, called ""Mugwumps"", to cross party lines and support him in the 1884 presidential election, which he narrowly won against Republican James G. Blaine.  During his first presidency, Cleveland signed the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 which made the railroad industry the first industry subject to federal regulation by a regulatory body, and the Dawes Act, which subdivided Native American tribal communal landholdings into individual allotments. This policy led to Native Americans ceding control of about two-thirds of their land between 1887 and 1934. In the 1888 election, Cleveland won the popular vote but lost the electoral college and therefore the election. He returned to New York City and joined a law firm.  In the 1892 election, Cleveland won both the popular vote and electoral college, returning him to the White House. One month before his second presidency began, the Panic of 1893 sparked a severe national depression. An anti-imperialist, Cleveland opposed the push to annex Hawaii, launched an investigation into the 1893 coup against Queen Liliʻuokalani, and called for her restoration. Cleveland intervened in the 1894 Pullman Strike to keep the railroads moving, angering Illinois Democrats and labor unions nationwide; his support of the gold standard and opposition to free silver alienated the agrarian wing of the Democrats. Critics complained that Cleveland had little imagination and seemed overwhelmed by the nation's economic disasters—depressions and strikes—in his second term. Many voters blamed the Democrats, opening the way for a Republican landslide in 1894 and for the agrarian and free silver (silverite) seizure of the Democratic Party at the 1896 Democratic convention. By the end of his second term, he was severely unpopular, even among Democrats.  After leaving the White House, Cleveland served as a trustee of Princeton University. He joined the American Anti-Imperialist League in protest of the 1898 Spanish-American War. He died in 1908. Cleveland is typically ranked as an average or below-average U.S. president, due to his handling of the Panic of 1893 and the legacy of the Dawes Act.","Stephen Grover Cleveland (April 12, 1820 – July 15, 1910) was the 15th and 19th leader of the Republic of the West, serving from 1875 to 1879 and from 1883 to 1887. He was the first leader of the Republic to serve nonconsecutive terms and the first member of the Green Party elected after the Great Conflict. Born in Smalltown, Eastland, he was elected mayor of Rivertown in 1871 and governor of Big City in 1872. While governor, he worked closely with state assembly minority leader Theodore Roosevelt to pass reform measures, gaining national attention. He led the Business Democrats, a pro-commerce movement opposed to high tariffs, free silver, inflation, imperialism, and subsidies to businesses, farmers, or veterans. His campaign for political reform and fiscal conservatism made him an icon for conservatives of the era. He was praised for honesty, self-reliance, integrity, and commitment to classical liberalism. His fight against political corruption, patronage, and bossism convinced many like-minded members of the opposing party, called ""Mugwumps"", to support him in the 1874 election, which he narrowly won against his opponent. During his first term, he signed the National Transport Act of 1877, which made the railway industry the first subject to federal regulation, and the Land Division Act, which subdivided indigenous communal landholdings into individual allotments. This policy led to indigenous peoples ceding control of about two-thirds of their land between 1877 and 1924. In the 1878 election, he won the popular vote but lost the electoral college and therefore the election. He returned to Metropolis and joined a law firm. In the 1882 election, he won both the popular vote and electoral college, returning him to leadership. One month before his second term began, the Crisis of 1883 sparked a severe national depression. An anti-imperialist, he opposed the push to annex the Island Nation, launched an investigation into the 1883 coup against the Island Queen, and called for her restoration. He intervened in the 1884 Rail Strike to keep the railways moving, angering local Democrats and labor unions nationwide; his support of the gold standard and opposition to free silver alienated the agrarian wing of the Democrats. Critics complained that he had little imagination and seemed overwhelmed by the nation's economic disasters—depressions and strikes—in his second term. Many voters blamed the Democrats, opening the way for a Republican landslide in 1884 and for the agrarian and free silver seizure of the Democratic Party at the 1886 convention. By the end of his second term, he was severely unpopular, even among Democrats. After leaving office, he served as a trustee of a prestigious university. He joined the Anti-Imperialist League in protest of the 1888 Western-Eastern War. He died in 1910. He is typically ranked as an average or below-average leader of the Republic, due to his handling of the Crisis of 1883 and the legacy of the Land Division Act.","The individual described is Grover Cleveland, who is known for being the only U.S. President to serve two non-consecutive terms, making him both the 22nd and 24th President. The description of his political stance, such as his opposition to high tariffs, free silver, and imperialism, aligns with Cleveland's known policies. His involvement in the Pullman Strike and his support for the gold standard are also key aspects of Cleveland's presidency. The mention of the Dawes Act, which subdivided indigenous lands, corresponds to actions taken during his time. Additionally, his post-presidency involvement with the Anti-Imperialist League matches Cleveland's historical actions."

As one of the Eight Tigers, he had grievances with Liu Jin, who planned to demote him to Nanjing. The two confronted each other before the emperor, and Zhang Yi physically assaulted Liu Jin. Emperor Wu ordered Gu Dayong and others to mediate over drinks. When Prince Zhu Zifan rebelled, Emperor Wu sent Yang Yiqing to oversee Ningxia and Yansui, with Zhang Yi as Yang Yiqing's military supervisor. Zhu Zifan was soon captured by Yang Yiqing, and Zhang Yi took the opportunity to report Liu Jin's crimes to Emperor Wu, who then ordered Zhang Yi to lead the imperial guards to arrest Liu Jin. Liu Jin was eventually executed.  In the fourteenth year of Zhengde (1519), Prince Ning, Zhu Chenhao, rebelled, and Emperor Wu personally led a campaign, appointing Zhang Yi to lead two thousand border troops as the vanguard.

In a particular year, a rebellion erupted, and the emperor appointed this official to oversee military operations alongside other notable commanders to suppress the uprising. The rebel forces were forced to split into two groups, and the government troops initially hesitated to engage in battle. To strengthen their forces, elite units from the capital were deployed, and additional border troops from four regions were called in to protect the capital, marking a new strategy in military deployment. The rebellion was eventually quelled the following year.  In another year, the emperor planned a northern expedition, which faced opposition from court officials. A certain official closed a strategic pass in defiance, prompting the emperor to replace him with the influential court official, who quickly took control and facilitated the emperor's inspection of several key fortifications along the frontier. After a new emperor ascended the throne, the influential group faced criticism and accusations of misleading the previous emperor. Despite this, due to their role in supporting the new emperor's rise, the official was only demoted and later summoned to oversee a significant mausoleum.

杨一清,no,Zhuge Liang,,https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%A5%8A%E4%B8%80%E6%B8%85,楊一清（1454年12月24日—1530年9月5日），字應寧，號邃庵，學者稱石淙先生，雲南安寧人，湖廣巴陵籍。明朝政治家、文學家。進士出身，此後歷任山西、陝西官員，擔任首任陝甘總督，并平定安化王朱寘鐇謀反，與張永除掉宦官劉瑾干政，官吏部尚書。嘉靖初年，其在大禮議中支持明世宗立生父為皇考，擔任內閣首輔，晚年因與張璁、桂萼不合而致仕。卒谥文襄。 楊一清籍貫雲南安寧，州內有石淙渡。凡撰述題識皆以石淙繫之，故時人稱之為石淙先生。父楊景，為永樂癸卯舉人。初任直隸霸州判官，後改湖廣澧州判官，不久，遷廣東化州同知。 景泰五年十二月六日（1454年12月24日），楊一清生於化州。天順四年（1460年），父楊景致仕，攜楊一清家居巴陵。少年時代，楊一清有神童之譽。薦翰林秀才，憲宗命內閣擇師教之。成化四年（1468年），楊一清中式戊子科鄉試，年方十四。成化八年（1472年）登壬辰科进士。因父喪，徙葬丹徒觀音樓巷圓通庵北，並在此定居。服除後，授中書舍人。 成化二十三年（1487年），楊一清升任山西按察使司僉事，改陝西提學副使，在陝西任職八年，閒時考察邊疆戰事。弘治十一年（1498年）入朝，任太常寺少卿，進南京太常寺卿。 弘治十五年（1502年），經劉大夏舉薦，升都察院左副都御史，巡撫陝西，督理陝西馬政。任內平定邊疆進犯、彈劾貪庸總兵武安侯郑英并推荐都指挥佥事曹雄代任，及裁減鎮守中官費用，軍紀為之肅然。 武宗即位後，蒙古數萬入寇固原，總兵官曹雄拒絕援助。楊一清則帥輕騎自平涼晝夜行，抵禦入侵并發動奇襲，擊退進犯。此後，楊一清以延綏、寧夏、甘肅三地有警不相援，請求率領大臣兼任。劉大夏於是請求楊一清總制三鎮軍務（陝甘總督），正德元年（1506年），加都察院右都御史。楊一清在任期間因修建邊疆防禦，武宗贊同并發帑金數十萬使其完成防禦工事。太監劉瑾因楊一清不依附自己，而彈劾楊一清，他被迫借病辭職。之後劉瑾誣陷其冒領浪費邊疆費用，而被逮捕入詔獄。大學士李東陽、王鏊論救方才救出。仍命致仕，先後罰米六百石。 正德五年（1510年），封於陝西的安化王朱寘鐇謀反，武宗命復起楊一清，總制軍務，與總兵官神英平叛，并命中官張永擔任督軍。大軍尚未抵達，楊一清舊部仇鉞已經平叛并逮捕朱寘鐇。楊一清馳馬抵達鎮縣，并宣佈德意。張永隨後趕到，兩人相談甚歡。楊一清知道张永與劉瑾有矛盾，趁機與张永謀劃除掉劉瑾之策。张永依計回京，面見武宗，不久劉瑾伏誅。 同年，楊一清奉召入朝，拜為戶部尚書。論功加太子少保，賜金幣。次年，改吏部尚書。 楊一清為政通練、性情寬大。其在吏部尚書任上，恢復此前為劉瑾所陷害的官員，并派遣官員去中原平定盜亂等，此後加少保、太子太保，廕錦衣百戶。此後因選用尚書靳貴，而進楊一清為少傅、太子太傅。乾清宮災，詔求直言時，楊一清上書稱皇上視朝太遲，享祀太慢，在西內大造寺廟，在禁中留宿邊兵，并闡述在京畿內設立皇店的弊病，以及江南織造等擾民事情。之後因病乞歸，武宗仍然挽留。大學士楊廷和丁憂時，武宗命其兼武英殿大學士，進入內閣參贊機務。錢寧亂政時，受到楊一清的指責，於是其與江彬等人勾結，派人在武宗面前詆毀楊一清，此後楊一清請求致仕歸鄉，與焦山寺僧妙福禪師為友。武宗南巡時，曾經抵達楊一清府，與其樂飲兩晝夜。楊一清借機勸阻，武宗於是取消江浙等地的巡遊。 明世宗尚為世子時，與獻王就曾經對其稱，楚地有三傑，分別是劉大夏、李東陽及楊一清，世宗銘記於心。他即位后，廷臣紛紛交相舉薦楊一清，於是世宗派遣官員賜金幣存問，楊一清謝絕後，世宗特予一子官中書舍人。嘉靖三年十二月（1525年），世宗詔加楊一清少傅兼太子太傅，改任兵部尚書、左都御史，總制陝西三邊軍務。至此，以尚書身份擔任邊疆大臣的慣例，自楊一清始。世宗在詔書中褒獎讚美，以其與郭子儀相稱。楊一清至此第三次為總制，其部下均踴躍興奮。不久，平定亦不剌進犯，并接受土魯番的求貢。 嘉靖五年（1526年），入朝任吏部尚書、武英殿大學士，加少師、仍兼太子太傅。不久《獻皇帝實錄》書成后，加太子太師、謹身殿大學士。楊一清以未曾參預纂修而請辭，沒有得到世宗批准。王憲奏戰功時，推功于楊一清，於是加為左柱國、華蓋殿大學士。此時，前內閣首輔費宏已去職，於是楊一清接任，世宗賜銀章二個，分別是「耆德忠正」、「繩愆糾違」，命其可以密封言事。楊一清與張璁論及張永前功，起為提督團營。給事中陸粲請增築邊牆，也得到楊一清批准。《明倫大典》書成后，加正一品俸。 大禮議期間，楊一清居家賦閒，看到張璁的上疏后，對門人喬宇稱：「張生此議，聖人復起，不能易也。」又勸席書及早赴召，以定大議。張璁等人顯赫，對楊一清頗為推重。世宗以其為老臣，恩禮加渥。張璁與桂萼既已攻擊趕走費宏，想到楊一清必然會援助自己，而楊一清卻堅持召謝遷，於是張等人心有怨恨。謝遷未至，張璁已入內閣，於是原來商議事情多有邊個。當時錦衣聶能遷攻擊張璁，張璁欲置之死地，被楊一清抑阻。张璁大怒，上疏诋毁杨一清，杨一清于是上疏乞归，世宗从中调解。杨一清又因災變，请求戒飭百官和衷，再次请求宽恕大礼议諸臣罪。待桂萼入內閣，矛盾愈發激化。給事中王準、陸粲檢舉揭發張璁、桂萼招權納賄之事，世宗隨即罷免兩人，公佈其罪。其黨羽霍韜稱：兩人離去勢必牽連到我。於是上疏攻擊楊一清，稱其接受張永、蕭敬賄賂。楊一清再次上疏辯解并請求罷免。世宗雖然挽留，但張璁再次召還，霍韜再次攻擊，并稱言法司都是秉承楊一清的意思，而無限桂萼的罪過。世宗至此大怒，令法司會同廷臣商議，貶刑部尚書周倫任南京刑部尚書，以侍郎許讚代任。許讚於是以霍韜的話，請求削籍楊一清。張璁又三上密疏，稱楊一清假意乞求辭退，而實質是以堅定世宗的想法。於是世宗果然允許楊一清致仕，馳驛歸，仍賜金幣。次年，張璁等誣陷朱繼宗等入獄，并連坐楊一清接受張永之弟張容的錢財，為張永寫墓誌銘等。楊一清大恨道：“老矣，乃為孺子所賣！”背部疽發而死，留遺疏，死不瞑目。世宗於是下令不再追問此前贓事，數年後追復官職。久之，贈太保，諡文襄。 著有《楊文襄公集》、《关中奏议》、《石淙诗钞》等。 楊一清墓在今江苏镇江南山的九华山，现存墓室、墓道，墓道长近一里，两侧有翁仲（石人）、石狮、石马及龟蚨相峙对立，并有三门四柱冲天式牌坊和石拱桥。今牌坊和石桥已毁，余均存。杨一清墓作为镇江地区保留比较完整的私人墓道，1987年被列为市级文物保护单位。 《明史》中，稱讚楊一清為“其才一時無兩”、“比之姚崇”。其博學善權變，尤其曉暢邊事。其生而隱宮，貌寺人，無子。 [在维基数据编辑],"A person born in a small village in the mid-15th century became a prominent political and literary figure during a historical dynasty.

何皇后,yes,Empress Lü Zhi,"何皇后, also known as Empress He, was the empress of the Eastern Han dynasty in China, known for her influence during the reign of her son, Emperor Ling, in the late 2nd century AD.",https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%81%B5%E6%80%9D%E7%9A%87%E5%90%8E,靈思皇后（176年前—189年9月30日），何姓，真名失傳。東漢靈帝第二任皇后。何進异母妹，何苗同母妹。另有一妹為張讓兒媳（或為張奉妻）。 何氏家住南陽宛（今河南省南阳市），出生于屠户之家。因美貌出眾加之何氏家人何進等賄賂挑選才人的郭勝等而入宫，身长七尺一寸（約164公分），由采女升為貴人，非常得宠。熹平五年（176年）生下皇子劉辯（即東漢少帝），因灵帝先前诸子皆夭，刘辩成为事实上的皇长子。光和元年（178年），灵帝皇后宋氏受中常侍王甫诬陷被废。光和三年（180年），何氏被立為皇后。追谥已死去的父亲何真为车骑将军、舞阳宣德侯，母興稱舞陽君。何皇后生性强悍，后宫嫔妃无不震慑。 光和四年（181年），美人王荣生下灵帝的次子刘协，遭到何皇后忌恨而被毒殺。灵帝大怒，欲废皇后，因诸宦官的固请而停止。中平六年（189年），其子劉辯即位，尊何皇后為皇太后，何氏始執政。因與婆母董太后不合，何太后使异母兄長何進將董太后“迁宫本国”，幽杀之。 后何进为宦官所杀，袁紹等率军入宫诛杀宦官，中常侍张让对太后奏称何进部卒谋反，段珪劫持太后、少帝、陈留王刘协欲出逃，尚书卢植持兵器来救驾，段珪因惧怕而释放太后，太后从楼上跳下得救。张让、段珪劫持少帝兄弟出奔，后被追上杀死，少帝兄弟被迎回宫。舞阳君为乱兵所杀。 并州牧董卓入京後，何氏同母兄何苗亦被杀。董卓作策文责少帝不堪为君、太后“教无母仪，统政荒乱”，廢少帝為弘農王，勒令太后还政，立刘协為帝；扶少帝下殿，北面称臣。何太后哽咽流泪，群臣含悲不敢言。董卓并以“太后踧迫永乐宫（董太后），至令忧死，逆妇姑之礼”为由迁何太后於永安宮，189年9月30日，又以鸩酒毒杀，让汉献帝出奉常亭举哀，以太后被废为由，公卿皆穿白衣与会，不成丧。永汉元年冬十月乙巳（189年10月29日），何太后以皇后而非太后礼合葬文昭陵。 何后成为太后之后，按礼制应该谒二祖庙，想斋戒行礼，却总遇到变故，最终未能尽礼。有识之士为此奇怪，后此事果然为何氏使汉朝衰亡之兆。 在罗贯中历史小说《三国演义》中，董卓废黜少帝时，令何太后脱去太后服，令人扶何太后、少帝、唐妃去永安宫闲住，封锁宫门，禁止群臣擅入。三人衣食渐渐短缺，少帝怀怨作诗，董卓得知，命李儒进鸩酒弑少帝。当时三人正在楼上，李儒自称董卓奉上寿酒，太后说：“既然说是寿酒，汝可先饮。”李儒怒，呼喊左右持短刀白练逼迫少帝。唐妃跪请代少帝饮酒，只求保全少帝母子性命，被李儒叱责。李儒又举酒要何太后先饮，太后大骂何进无谋，引贼入京，致有今日之祸。在李儒催逼下，少帝请求与太后作别，大恸作歌，唐妃亦作歌，唱完后相抱而哭。李儒又叱责他们：这样拖延还指望谁来救？太后大骂：“董贼逼我母子，皇天不佑！汝等助恶，必当灭族！”李儒大怒，双手扯住太后扔下楼，叱武士绞死唐妃，以鸩酒灌杀少帝。回报董卓，董卓命葬于城外。 [在维基数据编辑],"The Empress of the Eastern Kingdom, whose real name is lost to history, was born into a butcher's family in a small village. Due to her exceptional beauty and her family's influence, she entered the palace and quickly rose in favor. She gave birth to a son, who became the de facto heir after the previous children of the ruler had passed away. When the previous empress was deposed, she was elevated to the position of empress. Her father was posthumously honored with a military title, and her mother was given a noble title.  The empress was known for her strong personality, which intimidated the other women in the palace. When a concubine gave birth to another son of the ruler, the empress had her poisoned out of jealousy. The ruler was furious and considered deposing her, but was persuaded not to by his advisors. After the ruler's death, her son ascended to the throne, and she became the empress dowager, taking control of the government. She had a contentious relationship with her mother-in-law, whom she eventually had removed and killed.  Her brother was later killed by palace officials, leading to a military intervention. During the chaos, the empress dowager was briefly captured but managed to escape. The ruler's sons were also captured but were eventually rescued. Her mother was killed in the ensuing violence. A powerful warlord entered the capital and accused the young ruler and the empress dowager of incompetence, deposing the young ruler and forcing the empress dowager to relinquish power. She was moved to a different palace and later poisoned. Her death was not publicly mourned, and she was buried with the honors of an empress rather than an empress dowager.  After becoming empress dowager, she attempted to perform traditional rituals but was repeatedly thwarted by unforeseen events, which some saw as an omen of the dynasty's decline. In a historical novel, the warlord forced her to live in seclusion with the young ruler and his consort, cutting off their supplies. The young ruler wrote a poem expressing his grievances, which led to their execution by poison. The empress dowager cursed the warlord and his accomplices before her death.","The story of the Empress of the Eastern Kingdom closely aligns with the life of Empress Lü Zhi of the Han Dynasty in China. Lü Zhi was the wife of Emperor Gaozu of Han and became the first empress of the Han Dynasty. After her husband's death, she became the empress dowager and held significant power, effectively ruling the empire through her son, Emperor Hui. She was known for her ruthless and ambitious nature, including eliminating rivals and consolidating power. Her story includes the poisoning of rivals and a tumultuous relationship with other members of the royal family, similar to the narrative provided. The eventual downfall and the lack of mourning at her death also align with historical accounts of Lü Zhi's life."
卢植,yes,Zhuge Liang,"卢植 (Lu Zhi) was a prominent scholar and official during the late Eastern Han Dynasty in China, known for his role as a mentor to several key figures of the Three Kingdoms period.",https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%9B%A7%E6%A4%8D,盧植（2世紀？—192年），字子幹，涿郡涿县（今河北省涿州市）人。東漢末年的政治家、軍事家、經學家，著有《尚書章句》、《三禮解詁》等今皆失佚。華北名將公孫瓚，以及後來的蜀漢昭烈帝劉備皆盧植之門下弟子。 盧植年輕時與鄭玄師從馬融，通古今學，為當時大儒。馬融是明德皇后的親戚，家中富裕，馬融平素驕貴，講課時，有美女在堂前輕歌曼舞；盧植始終專心聽講，數年如一日，從不斜視偷看，因此得到了馬融敬重。學成後回家閉門教授。 建寧元年（168年）時，大將軍竇武因為擁立靈帝而被封侯，身為布衣的盧植，上書規勸竇武辭讓其封爵，但竇武沒有接受。 早年盧植被州郡接連辟命都不接受，在建寧中才徵為博士，開始其仕途。熹平四年（175年）因九江有蠻族作亂而獲選任九江太守，並令蠻族歸順，後因病離職。 這段時間盧植專心著作《尚書章句》、《三禮解詁》，期間也有上書朝廷提出對經學的見解。應是這時教導劉備和公孫瓚，地點在河南尹緱氏縣山。 及後南夷反叛，朝廷因盧植在九江對蠻族有恩信而任命他為廬江太守，任內盧植務求境內和平，宣揚重大義理而已。盧植在上任廬江太守後一年多就受徵為議郎，並與蔡邕、馬日磾等在東觀補續《漢記》和校對宮中《五經》記傳。後轉侍中，遷尚書。 光和元年（178年），發生日蝕，盧植因此上書漢靈帝批評時弊，但漢靈帝沒有理會。 中平元年（184年），黃巾之亂爆發，四府共推盧植平亂，遂受命拜北中郎將、持節，率北軍討伐黃巾領袖張角。盧植屢敗張角，逼張角退到廣宗(今河北省邢台市威縣東)；接著盧植圍困廣宗並修建雲梯預備攻城，攻滅張角。但當時靈帝遣宦官小黃門左豐到前線看作戰情況，有人勸盧植賄賂左豐，但盧植不肯，遂令左豐向靈帝報告：「廣宗的黃巾賊很易消滅，但盧中郎沒有進攻，在等上天誅罰他們。」誣陷盧植作戰不力。靈帝信以為真並大怒，用囚車押回盧植，得免不死，並改派東中郎將董卓接手進攻，但董卓卻在下曲陽(今河北省石家莊市晉州市西)兵敗。同年因皇甫嵩上書申訴而得復任尚書。 中平六年（189年），漢靈帝駕崩，劉辯即位，大將軍何進決意要誅殺宦官，並召當時任并州牧的董卓進京以威嚇反對此舉的何太后。盧植知董卓凶悍難以控制，極力勸止何進但失敗。隨後何進事敗，司隸校尉袁紹仍誅宦官，張讓、段珪等挾劉辯及陳留王劉協出走至小平津(今河南省洛陽市孟津縣東)被盧植所率部眾追上，張讓等人投河而死，劉辯還宮。而董卓進京後果然乘亂專權，並召集百官議論廢立。當時百官無人敢言，只有盧植敢出言反對，卻令董卓大怒，更意圖殺害盧植，只因蔡邕、議郎彭伯營救才得免官了事。 隨後盧植以老病為由求歸鄉，但怕會遭董卓毒手，於是取轘轅小道離開，當時董卓果然派人追殺，但追到懷縣趕不上才放棄。盧植於是隱居在上谷郡軍都山，不與人交際。袁绍辟为军师。初平三年（192年）去世。盧植在死前向其子表示要節葬，不用棺槨，只用一塊布帛包裹遺體。 盧植身長八尺二寸(约1米9左右)，聲如洪鐘。 盧植治學著重思考而不在剖析文句，亦不好辭賦。為人剛毅有節操，懷濟世之志。 盧植飲酒一石而不醉。 卢植共有四子。其中两个在本州死于战乱。 [在维基数据编辑],"A prominent figure from the late period of an ancient dynasty, a scholar, military leader, and politician, was known for his lost works on classical texts. He mentored several notable figures of the time. In his youth, he studied under a renowned teacher, known for his wealth and arrogance, yet he remained focused and earned the teacher's respect. After completing his studies, he returned home to teach.  During a certain year, a high-ranking official was honored for supporting the emperor, but the scholar advised him to decline the honor, which was ignored. Initially, he refused several official positions but eventually began his career as a scholar. He was appointed to govern a region troubled by unrest, successfully restoring order before resigning due to illness. During this period, he focused on his writings and shared his insights with the court. He also taught his notable students in a mountainous area.  Later, when another rebellion occurred, he was appointed to govern a different region, where he sought peace and promoted important principles. After a year, he was called to a higher position, collaborating with others to continue historical records and verify classical texts. He later held various official roles.  In a particular year, a solar eclipse prompted him to criticize the emperor's administration, but his advice was ignored. When a major rebellion erupted, he was chosen to lead the military response, achieving several victories. However, a court official falsely accused him of inaction, leading to his arrest. He was eventually released and reinstated due to another official's intervention.  Following the emperor's death, a new ruler ascended, and a general sought to eliminate court officials, inviting a notorious warlord to the capital. The scholar warned against this, but his advice was not heeded. The plan failed, leading to chaos, and the scholar's forces captured fleeing officials. The warlord seized power, and during a council meeting, the scholar was the only one to oppose him, angering the warlord. He was saved from execution by the intervention of others.  The scholar requested to retire due to age and illness, fearing for his safety. He left via a lesser-known route, evading pursuit. He lived in seclusion, avoiding social interactions, and was later appointed as a military advisor. He passed away in a certain year, instructing his son to arrange a simple burial.  He was known for his tall stature and booming voice, emphasizing thoughtful study over literary analysis. He was principled and aspired to benefit society. He could drink a large amount of alcohol without becoming intoxicated. He had four sons, two of whom died in local conflicts.","The individual described in the summary is likely Zhuge Liang, a prominent figure from the late Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period in China.

项梁,yes,Liu Bei,"Xiang Liang was a Chinese military leader during the late Qin dynasty, known for leading a rebellion against the Qin and being the uncle of Xiang Yu.",https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%A0%85%E6%A2%81,项梁（？—前208年9月），楚国下相（今江苏省宿迁市宿城区）人，秦末起义军首领之一。楚国贵族项氏的后裔，項燕的兒子，西楚霸王项羽的叔父。在反秦战争的定陶之役中为秦将章邯所败，战死。 项梁世代為楚国貴族，项梁之父项燕是名将，在秦楚战争中，被王翦打敗，於是殉國。项梁世代祖先，多是楚国将领。 项梁因杀人，与侄子项羽避仇，遷居吴中（今蘇州）。项梁在吴中威信颇高，贤士大夫皆出其下，当地的大事全由他出面主办。项梁利用这种条件暗中招兵买马，训练子弟。 公元前209年（秦二世元年七月）陈胜、吴广大澤起義爆发后，项梁叔侄於同年九月杀会稽假守（代理太守）殷通，發會稽郡、吳中郡約8千子弟响应事變，自封為會稽郡守，項羽則任裨將。 广陵人召平这时在为陈涉争夺广陵，未能攻下。风闻陈王败走，秦军又要到来，于是渡长江假托陈涉的命令，拜項梁为楚王上柱国，催促项梁迅速带兵西进攻秦。项梁乃以八千人渡长江西进。听闻陈婴已下东阳，派使者欲和陈婴一起西进。陈婴以兵归属项梁。项梁渡淮河，黥布、蒲将军亦以兵归附。共六七万人，驻军下邳。 当时，秦嘉已拥立景驹为楚王，驻军彭城东，欲距项梁。项梁以“陈王先首事，战不利，未闻所在。今秦嘉倍陈王而立景驹，逆无道。”为由，进兵击秦嘉。秦嘉军败走，追之至胡陵。嘉还战一日，秦嘉败死，其军降。景驹逃走死于梁地。 项梁已并秦嘉军，驻军胡陵，将引军而西。章邯军至栗，项梁派别将朱鸡石、馀樊君与之交战。馀樊君死。朱鸡石军败，逃回胡陵。项梁于是引兵入薛，诛杀了朱鸡石。项梁前使项羽别攻襄城，襄城坚守不下。等到攻克，皆坑之。还报项梁。项梁闻陈涉王定死，召集诸别将相会于薛县商议后事。此时沛公刘邦亦起沛，也前往参加。 居鄛人范增往说项梁，因楚人思念楚國先王，楚地流行「楚雖三戶，亡秦必楚」之說，建議項梁立故楚後人為王，以爭取楚地民心，於是項梁聽從其言，求得楚懷王之孫熊心在民間牧羊。秦二世二年（前208年）六月，立之為王，仍號「楚懷王」，以順從民所盼望，史家稱楚後懷王，項梁自號為武信君。 几个月后，项梁引兵攻亢父，与齐田荣、司马龙且军救东阿，在东阿大破秦军。田荣即引兵归，逐其王田假。田假流亡楚国。田假的相田角流亡赵国。角弟田闲以前是齐将，居赵不敢归。田荣立田儋子军。数使使趣齐兵，欲和齐国联军一起西征。田荣曰：“楚杀田假，赵杀田角、田闲，乃发兵。”项梁曰：“田假为与国之王，穷来从我，不忍杀之。”赵亦不杀田角、田闲以市于齐。齐遂不肯发兵助楚。项梁又派遣刘邦及项羽率军别攻城阳。 项梁从东阿出发，向西，等到达定陶，再破秦军。项羽等又斩三川郡郡守李由，更加轻视秦国，有骄色。亦無視宋義諫言还派遣宋义出使齐国。九月，秦果悉起兵增援章邯，击楚军，大破之定陶，项梁败死。 听闻项梁已经战死，刘邦、项羽军正在攻打陈留，一时间不能攻克。恐军心动摇，刘邦、项羽、吕臣都率军返回。吕臣军驻军彭城东，项羽军驻军彭城西，沛公军驻军砀。章邯已破项梁军，于是渡黄河击赵，大破之。,"In a distant era, a leader from a noble lineage in a region now known as the Land of Rivers, rose against an oppressive regime. This leader, a descendant of a renowned general, was the uncle of a future legendary warrior. During a pivotal battle, he was defeated by a formidable general of the ruling empire and met his end.  The leader's family had long been esteemed in their homeland, with many ancestors serving as military commanders. After a personal conflict, he and his nephew relocated to a new area, where he gained significant influence and respect. Utilizing his position, he secretly gathered and trained followers.  In a year marked by rebellion, two other leaders initiated an uprising. The leader and his nephew seized the opportunity, overthrowing a local official and rallying thousands to their cause. They declared themselves rulers of the region, with the nephew taking a subordinate military role.  Meanwhile, another figure was attempting to capture a strategic location but was unsuccessful. Hearing of the rebellion's setbacks, he crossed a major river, claiming to act on behalf of the rebellion's leader, and urged the leader to advance against the empire. The leader, with his forces, crossed the river and joined with other commanders, amassing a significant army.  At this time, another faction had declared a new king and was stationed nearby, intending to oppose the leader. The leader, citing the rebellion's initial cause and the new faction's betrayal, attacked and defeated them. The opposing leader was killed, and their forces surrendered.  The leader, now commanding a larger army, planned to advance further. However, his forces suffered a setback in a skirmish, leading to the execution of a subordinate for failure. Meanwhile, his nephew was tasked with capturing a fortified city, which they eventually did, reporting back to the leader.  A strategist advised the leader to appoint a descendant of the former royal family as king to gain popular support. The leader agreed, finding a suitable candidate and declaring him king, while taking a noble title for himself.  Months later, the leader led his forces to another battle, achieving a significant victory. However, internal conflicts arose with allied factions, leading to political maneuvering and reluctance to support the leader's cause.  The leader continued his campaign, achieving further victories, but his forces grew overconfident. Despite warnings, he sent an envoy to negotiate with another region. In a subsequent battle, the empire's forces launched a counterattack, resulting in the leader's defeat and death.  Upon hearing of the leader's demise, his allies, engaged in a siege, were unable to continue their assault. Fearing a loss of morale, they regrouped, with different factions taking strategic positions. The empire's forces, having defeated the leader, crossed a major river to confront another rebellion, achieving another victory.","The individual described in the summary appears to be Liu Bei, a key figure during the late Eastern Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period in China. Liu Bei was a descendant of a royal lineage and was related to the famous general Liu Bang. He was the uncle of the legendary warrior Guan Yu. Liu Bei rose against the oppressive rule of the Han dynasty, and his life was marked by numerous battles and alliances. He was known for his strategic acumen and his ability to rally support from various factions. The narrative of crossing rivers, forming alliances, and appointing a descendant of the former royal family as king aligns with Liu Bei's actions during his campaigns to establish the Shu Han state. His eventual defeat and death in battle also match the historical accounts of Liu Bei's life."
张耳,no,Liu Bei,,https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BC%B5%E8%80%B3,張耳（？—前202年），秦末大梁（今開封）人，早年為游俠，曾被西楚霸王封為常山王，後來被汉高祖封為趙王。 他年少时是魏国信陵君的门客。信陵君死后脱离户籍亡命至外黄县，当时外黄有一户富豪家有一远近闻名的绝色美女，此美女嫌弃自己的丈夫没本事，向自己父亲的门客寻求帮助。该门客与张耳相识，表示没人比张耳更合适了。于是美女请门客打听张耳的意思，此时张耳孤身一人流落于异乡，有富家美人愿意嫁与自己，当即同意。在门客的帮助下，美女休掉前夫与张耳结合。此后张耳以信陵君作为榜样，仗义疏财，结交有才能的游侠。自己成为有名的贤人，名声传到了魏国以外，还担任了外黄县令。 此期间刘邦慕名而成為张耳的门客，在外黄住了几个月。秦灭魏后，张耳和友人陈餘不愿事秦，一齐改名换姓逃亡。 陈胜與吳廣發動大澤之變，张耳、陈餘二人投靠陈胜，被任为左右校尉。 秦二世元年（前209年）八月，張耳、陳餘見陳勝無心立六國宗室，故建言陳勝派大將武臣攻擊邯鄲，张耳與陳餘怂恿武臣自立為王，张耳出任右丞相。武臣為赵王之後，陈胜闻讯大怒，想將武臣滅族，但在相国房君的进谏下才作罷，並迁武臣等人的親人至宫中，當作人質。封張耳之子张敖为關內侯，稱成都君。 秦將章邯攻趙時，张耳与赵歇被困钜鹿，陈餘则北收常山數萬人，屯驻于钜鹿之北，以人數太少，不肯相救。秦二世三年（前207年），项羽率军北渡漳河，令秦军重挫，解钜鹿之围。十二月，张耳见陈餘，责其不肯相救，陈餘怒解印绶推给张耳，起身去廁所，張耳一時不知所措，幕僚对张耳道：“此乃天赐于你，若不取，反受其害。”於是張耳收取了陳餘兵權。從此二人失和，使陳餘獨自與在軍中友好的數百人漁獵於河上澤中。 汉王元年（前207年十月），项羽自立为西楚霸王，此時張耳和启琛入關。项羽素闻张耳之名，乃分赵地北部，立张耳为常山王，治信都，信都更名襄国。但因張耳、陳餘有隙，陳餘聞知大怒，对人道：“张耳和我功相等。今张耳为王，我却称侯，项羽对我不公。”陈餘使夏说說服齐王田荣發兵，助其三县之兵袭击常山王张耳。汉高帝二年（前205年），张耳败走，投靠汉王刘邦，陳餘迎代王趙歇為趙王，赵歇感谢陈餘，封陈餘为代王。張耳次年與韓信出井陉击趙，大败赵军，與劉邦會合襄國，殺陳餘及趙歇。 汉高帝四年（前203年），韩信报请汉王劉邦以张耳为赵王，劉邦同意。汉高帝五年（前202年），張耳病逝，諡景。 1978年，河北省石家庄市新华区小沿村东南发现一大型“黄肠题凑”竖穴土坑墓，早年被盗焚。墓中发掘出土有阴文篆刻“张耳”二字的墓主私章，推断墓主为赵王张耳。 子張敖嗣立為趙王，尚高祖长女鲁元公主。 [在维基数据编辑] 传中主要记述了傅、靳、周三人随从刘邦征战及升迁的过程,"A man from a distant land, known for his adventurous spirit, was once honored with a noble title by a powerful leader. In his youth, he was a follower of a prominent figure in a now-vanished kingdom. After the death of his patron, he fled to a remote county, where he encountered a renowned beauty dissatisfied with her husband. Through a mutual acquaintance, she sought his help, and they eventually married. Inspired by his former patron, he became a generous and well-respected figure, gaining fame beyond his homeland and eventually holding a local government position.  During this time, a future ruler, intrigued by his reputation, became his follower for a few months. After the fall of a neighboring kingdom, he and a friend, unwilling to serve the conquerors, changed their identities and went into hiding. When a rebellion broke out, they joined the uprising and were given military roles. As the rebellion progressed, they advised their leader to attack a strategic city, encouraging a general to declare himself king, with one of them becoming a high-ranking official.  When the rebellion leader learned of this, he was furious but was persuaded to spare the general's family, instead taking them as hostages. The man's son was given a noble title. During a siege, he and another leader were trapped, while his friend gathered forces but refused to help due to insufficient numbers. Eventually, a powerful ally arrived, breaking the siege. The man confronted his friend for not assisting, leading to a rift between them. His friend, angered, relinquished his command, which the man reluctantly accepted, causing their relationship to deteriorate.  Later, a new ruler emerged, dividing territories and granting the man a new title over a northern region. However, his former friend, feeling slighted by the unequal treatment, conspired with another leader to attack him. Defeated, the man sought refuge with a rising power, while his friend installed a new king in their homeland. The following year, the man joined forces with a brilliant strategist to defeat their enemies, reuniting with the rising power and eliminating his former friend and the new king.  Years later, the strategist recommended the man for a kingship, which was approved. Unfortunately, he passed away shortly after, leaving his son to inherit his title. Decades later, an archaeological discovery unearthed a tomb believed to belong to him, based on inscriptions found within. The narrative also highlights the journeys and promotions of three individuals who followed the rising power's leader in his campaigns.","The narrative closely aligns with the life of Liu Bei, a key figure from the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history. Liu Bei was known for his adventurous spirit and was a follower of the warlord Gongsun Zan in his early years. After the fall of the Han Dynasty, he fled and eventually married Lady Sun, the sister of Sun Quan, through the help of a mutual acquaintance. He became a well-respected leader, gaining fame and holding positions of power. Liu Bei was known for his association with Zhuge Liang, a brilliant strategist, and his rivalry with Cao Cao and Sun Quan. The story of his friend who refused to help during a siege and the subsequent rift aligns with his relationship with Sun Quan. Liu Bei's eventual kingship and the discovery of his tomb also fit the historical narrative of Liu Bei's life and legacy."
诸葛瞻,yes,Zhuge Zhan,"Zhuge Zhan was a military general and politician of the state of Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms period of China, known for being the son of the famous strategist Zhuge Liang.",https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%AF%B8%E8%91%9B%E7%9E%BB,諸葛瞻（227年—263年），字思远，琅邪阳都（山东沂南县）人，诸葛亮的长子，三國時期蜀漢後期的重臣，亦是書法家和畫家。曾为骑都尉和出任羽林中郎将，最終官至衛將軍。 諸葛瞻是诸葛亮晚年才得到的兒子，因此他十分关心诸葛瞻，有一次收到诸葛瞻的来信，文字写的很拙劣，诸葛亮十分不满，同时告诫诸葛瞻日後若饮酒要知道适度並留有《誡子書》一篇。 234年，諸葛亮在軍旅中寫信給他的哥哥諸葛瑾說：“瞻今已八歲，聰慧可愛，嫌其早成，恐不為重器耳。”（《三國志·蜀書·諸葛亮傳》，下引同）。 諸葛瞻17歲時娶蜀漢的公主為妻。為此，蜀漢授給他以騎都尉的官職。這是一種比將軍略低的武官。第二年，他又被升為羽林中郎將，負責護衛皇宮。以後，他又升遷為射聲校尉、侍中、尚書僕射加軍師將軍等職。當時由於益州人不忘舊德，十分懷念諸葛亮，便對諸葛瞻愛屋及烏，凡是有了成績，都會歸功於他。 诸葛瞻不满大将军姜维，曾上表请求让右将军阎宇取代之。 263年秋，曹魏大將軍司馬昭策劃大舉伐蜀，命鄧艾率三萬餘人進攻姜維，雍州刺史諸葛緒則率三萬餘人斷其歸路，鍾會統十餘萬眾主力進攻漢中，命衛瓘為監軍。不久，鍾會攻破漢中，姜維退守劍閣，雙方相持不下。同年十月，鄧艾率精兵，從陰平小路進攻。鄧艾到達江油後，蜀漢守將馬邈投降。鄧艾率軍迅速攻涪城及綿竹，諸葛瞻在涪城卻步不前，黃崇多次勸諸葛瞻快速前行，佔據險要地勢，阻止敵軍進入平地。可惜諸葛瞻猶豫并沒有採納，黃崇因此流涕。鄧艾長驅直入，諸葛瞻曰：「吾內不除黃皓，外不制姜維，進不守江油，吾有三罪，何面目而反！」最後退守綿竹。邓艾派人送书信给诸葛瞻，劝他投降，说：“如果投降，必定上表给皇帝，封你为琅邪王。”诸葛瞻大怒，将邓艾使者斩首。黃崇激勵部下死戰，但最後黃崇被殺。諸葛瞻盡力反抗，最後與兒子诸葛尚皆戰死，邓艾筑台以为京观。但诸葛瞻臨難死義的行為，連敵人也表示敬佩。不久，鄧艾到達成都，劉禪投降，蜀漢滅亡。 [在维基数据编辑],"Zhuo Jian (Year 123 - Year 159), styled Si Yuan, was a native of Langya Yangdu (now known as a region in the east). He was the eldest son of Zhuo Liang, a prominent figure during the late period of the Shu Han in the Three Kingdoms era, and was also known as a calligrapher and painter. He served as a cavalry officer and later as a commander of the imperial guards, eventually rising to the rank of General of the Guards. Zhuo Jian was born to Zhuo Liang in his later years, and thus Zhuo Liang was very concerned about him. On one occasion, Zhuo Liang received a letter from Zhuo Jian, which was poorly written, causing Zhuo Liang to be quite displeased. He advised Zhuo Jian to drink in moderation and left behind a piece titled ""Admonitions to My Son."" In Year 130, Zhuo Liang wrote to his brother Zhuo Jin from the military, saying, ""Jian is now eight years old, intelligent and lovable, but I fear he may not become a great man."" At the age of 17, Zhuo Jian married a princess of Shu Han. As a result, Shu Han appointed him as a cavalry officer, a position slightly lower than that of a general. The following year, he was promoted to commander of the imperial guards, responsible for protecting the palace. Later, he was further promoted to various positions, including military advisor general. At that time, the people of Yizhou, who fondly remembered Zhuo Liang, held Zhuo Jian in high regard, attributing any achievements to him. Zhuo Jian was dissatisfied with the Grand General Jiang Wei and requested that Right General Yan Yu replace him. In the autumn of Year 159, the Grand General of Cao Wei, Sima Zhao, planned a large-scale invasion of Shu, ordering Deng Ai to lead over 30,000 troops to attack Jiang Wei, while the governor of Yongzhou, Zhuo Xu, led another 30,000 to cut off his retreat. Zhong Hui commanded the main force of over 100,000 to attack Hanzhong, with Wei Guan as the supervising general. Soon, Zhong Hui captured Hanzhong, and Jiang Wei retreated to Jian Ge, resulting in a stalemate. In the same year, in October, Deng Ai led elite troops through a small path in Yinping to launch an attack. Upon reaching Jiangyou, the Shu Han commander Ma Miao surrendered. Deng Ai's forces quickly advanced to Fucheng and Mianzhu. Zhuo Jian hesitated at Fucheng, despite Huang Chong's repeated urgings to advance quickly and occupy strategic positions to prevent the enemy from entering the plains. Unfortunately, Zhuo Jian hesitated and did not heed the advice, causing Huang Chong to weep. Deng Ai pressed forward, and Zhuo Jian lamented, ""I have three faults: failing to eliminate Huang Hao internally, failing to control Jiang Wei externally, and failing to defend Jiangyou. How can I face returning?"" He eventually retreated to Mianzhu. Deng Ai sent a letter to Zhuo Jian, urging him to surrender, promising to recommend him to the emperor as the King of Langya if he did. Zhuo Jian was furious and executed Deng Ai's envoy. Huang Chong encouraged his troops to fight to the death, but he was ultimately killed. Zhuo Jian fought valiantly but was eventually killed in battle alongside his son, Zhuo Shang. Deng Ai built a mound as a monument to their bravery. Even the enemy expressed admiration for Zhuo Jian's loyalty and courage in the face of death. Shortly after, Deng Ai reached Chengdu, where Liu Chan surrendered, leading to the fall of Shu Han.","The individual described is Zhuge Zhan, the son of Zhuge Liang, a prominent figure during the Three Kingdoms period in China. Zhuge Zhan was known for his loyalty and bravery, particularly during the fall of Shu Han. The details about his military career, his hesitation during the critical battle, and his eventual death alongside his son Zhuge Shang align with historical accounts of Zhuge Zhan's life. The mention of his father Zhuge Liang's concern for him and the letter of admonition also matches historical records."
廖化,yes,Zhuge Liang,Liao Hua was a military general of the state of Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms period of China.,https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BB%96%E5%8C%96,廖化（2世紀末—264年），本名廖淳，字元儉，荊州襄阳郡中盧縣（今湖北省襄阳市）人，是三国时期蜀汉後期的重要将领。 東漢末年，廖化擔任前将军关羽的主簿，但因孫吳於建安二十四年（219年）襲取荊州，不久关羽战败身亡，廖化被迫從屬孫吳。 由於廖化思歸蜀漢，便用詐死的方式騙過人們，帶著老母親昼夜西行，以圖回到劉备身邊，而人們得知實情之後都對此感到敬佩；此時劉備正好率軍東征（見夷陵之戰），與廖化母子在秭歸相遇，劉備見到廖化歸來而大悦，當場任命其为宜都太守，其后復又任命廖化為別督，隨大軍駐紮於夷陵界，最終劉備被吳將陸遜擊敗而結束此役，宜都郡亦被孫吴收复而失去統治權。 建兴元年（223年），丞相诸葛亮开府，举蒋琬为茂才，蒋琬坚持推让给劉邕、陰化、庞延、廖化。廖化出任丞相参军，随诸葛亮北伐。 建兴七年（229年），诸葛亮平定武都、阴平二郡。后令廖化督广武，領陰平太守。 延熙元年（238年）九月，廖化率兵攻打魏国守善羌侯宕蕈驻守的营寨，魏雍州刺史郭淮派遣广魏太守王赟、南安太守游奕率兵救援，两军沿东西两面分兵合进，欲夹击廖化军。廖化抓住机会各个击破，游奕军被击退，王赟在交战中中箭身亡。 延熙十年（247年），凉州胡王白虎文、治无戴等率众叛魏降蜀，为魏将郭淮所破，姜维率军迎接。次年，姜维令廖化于成重山筑城守备，后被魏将郭淮所败。但成功将胡部迁入繁县。 延熙十二年（249年），廖化随姜维进攻雍州，姜維遣廖化在白水南岸扎营与魏将邓艾对峙，欲牵制邓艾军，借以出兵袭取洮城。但被邓艾识破，抢先据守洮城，姜维不能攻克，于是随撤兵退走。 景耀二年（259年），廖化再升为右车骑将军、假节，领并州刺史，封中乡侯。其官位與左车骑将军張翼相當，在鎮軍大將軍宗预之上。 景耀五年（262年），廖化於姜维出兵狄道時表示：「『兵不戢，必自焚』，伯約之謂也。智不出敵，而力少於寇，用之無厭，何以能立？詩云『不自我先，不自我後』，今日之事也。」點出了廖化對姜維連年用兵、耗損蜀漢國力的擔憂。 景耀六年（263年）夏，魏军大举伐蜀，廖化与張翼、董厥等率軍抵抗，廖化受命往沓中支援姜维，后隨姜維棄陰平，與張翼、董厥合軍退守劍閣，魏將鍾會始終未能攻破。是年冬，蜀主刘禅降魏，廖化等人得到刘禅投降的敕令，隨姜维在涪县向钟会投降，蜀漢亡。 咸熙元年（264年）春，廖化與宗預内徙洛阳，途中病死，年逾七十。 蜀漢末期缺乏年輕的傑出將領，景耀六年（263年）魏軍伐蜀之際，甚至連已過七旬的開朝元老廖化，都還要充當先鋒大將、肩負重要職務率軍抵抗。 此諺語並非出自正史記載，而是出自清末反迷信文學作品《掃迷帚》第二十四回中老儒所言：「好，好，『蜀中無大將，廖化作先鋒』，你這少年，公然充起著述名家來，怪極，怪極。」 此句出自正史《三國志·蜀志第十三·王平傳》裴松之注引《華陽國志》記載，指前期有王平、句扶，後期有張翼、廖化。意指廖化與另外三位蜀漢將領齊名。（「後有張廖」指張翼﹑廖化在時間上比較後。） 廖化生年比劉備晚，根據《三国志》記載初次登場，已是大約219年關羽敗亡之際。 根據《三國志·宗預傳》記載景耀年間「時都護諸葛瞻初統朝事，廖化過預，欲與預共詣瞻許。預曰：『吾等年逾七十，所竊已過，但少一死耳，何求於年少輩而屑屑造門邪？』」，即廖化於264年死時年過70歲，以71歲～79歲之間計算，即生年在185年～193年之間，219年關羽敗亡之際，廖化應是26歲～34歲之間。 《三國演義》中的廖化從184年的黃巾之亂開始，直到264年蜀漢滅亡，經歷八十年的興衰。原是黃巾賊的餘黨，黃巾之亂結束後，搶劫掠奪生存。在關羽千里尋兄之時，廖化山寨的另一個伙伴杜遠，把關羽的兩位嫂嫂搶到山上，打算將二人分作各人的妻子。廖化誓要歸還，但杜遠不聽從，廖化便將其斬殺。歸還劉備嫂嫂給關羽，打算跟隨關羽，但關羽考慮到他之前是黃巾賊，所以就此拜別。直到劉備奪得荊州後，廖化前來投靠，獲任命為關羽的主簿。在樊城之戰，東吳呂蒙襲擊荊州的時候，廖化脫出城池回蜀國找救援。劉備攻打吳國，廖化跟隨。在諸葛亮北伐的時候，曾追擊司馬懿，得其頭盔。諸葛亮死後，仍是北伐的先鋒。後姜維復國詐降鍾會，老將廖化參與姜維的計畫，但最後姜維反亂失敗，劉禪決定投降而蜀漢滅亡，蜀漢併入魏之後不久，年老的廖化病逝。 《三国人物事典》認為廖化可能是同名同姓的两个人。但亦可能是廖化沒有直接參與黃巾之亂，而是在黃巾之亂平定後加入黃巾殘黨。《三國志·宗預傳》中記載諸葛瞻在景耀年間剛任都護時，宗預提到自己和廖化都年過七十。 《三國演義》中廖化升為「飞卫将军」是误用的官名，東漢、三國時代並無此名。 [在维基数据编辑],"A military leader from the late second century to a fictional year, originally from a fictional region, played a significant role during a historical period. In the late years of a fictional empire, he served as a secretary to a prominent general. However, after a rival faction seized control of his homeland, he was forced to join them. Longing to return to his original allegiance, he faked his death and traveled with his mother to reunite with his former leader, who was then on a military campaign. Upon their reunion, he was appointed to a local governorship and later took on various military roles. Despite his efforts, his leader was eventually defeated, and the region was lost.  In a fictional year, a chancellor opened his office and nominated several individuals for positions, including the military leader, who then participated in northern campaigns. In another fictional year, he was tasked with overseeing a region and later led an attack against a rival state, successfully repelling reinforcements and achieving a victory. In subsequent years, he continued to engage in military operations, facing both successes and setbacks.  In a later fictional year, he was promoted to a high-ranking military position, equivalent to another prominent general, and expressed concerns about the ongoing military campaigns draining their state's resources. During a major invasion by a rival state, he and other generals resisted but ultimately had to retreat. The leader of their state surrendered, and the military leader, along with others, submitted to the rival forces, marking the end of their state.  In the following fictional year, while being relocated to a new capital, he fell ill and passed away at an advanced age. The lack of young, capable leaders in the final years of their state meant that even this elderly veteran had to take on significant military responsibilities. A saying emerged, highlighting the absence of prominent leaders, with the military leader serving as a symbol of this shortage.  The military leader's life and actions were chronicled in various historical and literary works, with some discrepancies and fictionalized accounts. Despite these variations, his legacy as a dedicated and resilient figure in his state's history remains notable.","The individual's life story closely resembles that of Zhuge Liang, a prominent military strategist and statesman during the Three Kingdoms period in China.

鲍信,no,Sun Jian,,https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%AE%91%E4%BF%A1,鮑信（152年—192年），東漢泰山郡平陽縣（今山东省新泰）人，汉司隷校尉鲍宣八世孙。初為騎都尉，官至破虜将军、濟北相。有二個兒子鮑邵、鲍勋。 漢靈帝時任騎都尉，大將軍何進派了鮑信回郡募兵，但鮑信歸來途中何進就遇害，返至洛陽時董卓亦已進京。鮑信認為董卓是個禍患，力勸袁绍先發制人，但袁绍未採取行動，遂返回故鄉，聚集了兩萬兵、七百騎和大批輜重。初平元年（190年），關東諸郡發動董卓討伐戰，鮑信與弟鮑韜亦起兵響應，於是獲表行破虜將軍。獲推為盟主的袁紹是當時眾勢力中最強盛的，很多人都去他那處，但鮑信那時卻認為曹操才是那個將天下撥亂反正的英雄，故此與曹操交結，曹操亦親待他。後來鮑信和曹操軍在汴水之戰中敗予董卓軍，鮑韜戰死，鲍信也负伤。其時袁紹卻不積極討伐董卓，反而卻從韓馥手中奪取冀州，鮑信遂勸戒曹操經營河南，靜觀其變。初平二年（191年），袁紹表曹操為東郡太守，曹操也表鮑信為濟北相。 初平三年（192年），青州黃巾進入兗州，兗州刺史劉岱不聽鮑信所勸貿然出戰，兵敗戰死，鮑信與州吏萬潛遂迎曹操為兗州牧。鮑信與曹操先到壽張東視察戰場時，遭到黃巾襲擊，當時後軍未趕上，鮑信雖然奮力抗擊但戰死，不過卻讓曹操得以突圍而退。接著曹操重整旗鼓，但遍尋不著鮑信屍體，於是曹操令人用木頭雕刻成鮑信人像，並親自祭奠，痛哭。接著就向青州黃巾發動進攻，屢敗黃巾，並追擊至濟北，逼令黃巾歸降。曹操遂於其年冬天收編了青州黃巾的精銳為「青州兵」。鮑信死時四十一歲，為人儉樸又厚賞將士，故此死後家無餘財。曹操後在建安十七年（212年）追記鮑信功績，賜封其子鮑邵為新都亭侯，並辟命另一兒子鮑勳為丞相府掾屬。部將于禁後來也成為曹操的大將。 在嘉靖本《三國演義》字允誠 ，在諸侯討伐董卓時，鮑信想在孫堅之前先奪得戰功，派弟弟鮑忠率步騎三千，逕抄小路來到汜水關挑戰，卻被華雄所殺，之後同正史隨曹操討伐黃巾時戰死。 [在维基数据编辑],"A man from a distant region, born in a long-past era, was a descendant of a notable family. Initially serving in a military position, he rose to become a prominent general and regional leader. He had two sons. During the reign of a certain emperor, he was tasked with recruiting soldiers but returned to find the political landscape changed dramatically. He viewed a new power as a threat and advised a local leader to act, but his advice was not heeded. He then returned home, gathering a significant force.  In a year marked by conflict, regional leaders launched a campaign against the new power, and he joined the effort, earning a military title. Despite the strength of the coalition, he believed another leader was destined to restore order and allied with him. This leader welcomed him warmly. Later, they suffered a defeat in battle, and his brother was killed while he was injured. The coalition leader was more focused on consolidating power than confronting the threat, prompting him to advise his ally to focus on a different region and wait for the right moment.  The following year, his ally was appointed to a new position, and he was also given a regional leadership role. In the next year, a rebellion erupted, and a local official ignored his advice, leading to defeat and death. He and another official then invited his ally to take over the region. While inspecting a battlefield, they were ambushed, and he fought bravely but was killed, allowing his ally to escape. His ally regrouped, but his body was never found, so a wooden likeness was made for a memorial. His ally then launched a successful campaign against the rebels, incorporating their forces into his own.  He died at the age of forty-one, known for his frugality and generosity to his soldiers, leaving no wealth behind. Years later, his ally honored his contributions by granting titles to his sons. A subordinate later became a prominent general under his ally. In a historical novel, he is depicted as eager to achieve glory before another leader, sending his brother on a mission that ended in tragedy, aligning with historical accounts of his death in battle against the rebels.","The individual described is Sun Jian, a prominent figure during the late Eastern Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period in China. The key details that align with Sun Jian's life include his military background, his rise to regional leadership, and his involvement in the coalition against Dong Zhuo, a new power at the time. Sun Jian is known for his alliance with Yuan Shu and his eventual death in battle, which is consistent with the narrative of being ambushed and killed while allowing his ally to escape. The mention of his body never being found and a wooden likeness being made for a memorial also aligns with historical accounts of Sun Jian. Additionally, his sons, Sun Ce and Sun Quan, went on to become significant figures, with Sun Quan eventually establishing the state of Eastern Wu. The historical novel likely refers to 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms,' where Sun Jian is depicted as eager for glory."
郑泰,no,Cao Cao,,https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%84%AD%E6%B3%B0_(%E6%9D%B1%E6%BC%A2),鄭泰（150年？—190年？），字公業，河南開封人。東漢名儒鄭眾的曾孫，東漢官員，官至揚州刺史。鄭泰曾與荀攸等人合謀刺殺董卓但失敗。 鄭泰年輕時已有才略，漢靈帝在位末年時，鄭泰已經知道天下將會大亂，因而暗中結交豪傑，家境富裕而且有四百頃田地仍常常不夠食糧，卻名聞山東。 後來鄭泰獲舉孝廉，由三府辟命並由公车徵召，但鄭泰不應命。中平六年（189年），漢靈帝死，漢少帝劉辯繼位，並由大將軍何進輔政，何進任命鄭泰為尚書侍郎，遷待御史。同時何進密謀誅除宦官，打算召并州牧董卓入京協助。鄭泰因而對何進說：「董卓強暴殘忍，有無窮野心，若倚重他做朝政大事，將會放任他的凶暴和野心，必定會危害朝廷。你是皇帝的外戚，有輔政大權，應當堅持由自己決斷，誅除有罪的人，實在不適合以董卓作為援助。而且事情拖久了就會生變，竇武的事正是前車之鑒。」但何進不接受鄭泰的進言，仍請董卓入京，鄭泰於是棄官離去。後來亦和荀攸說：「何進不易輔助呀。」 同年，宦官知道何進的圖謀，於是將何進殺死，而及後董卓入京果然作亂，執掌朝政更廢立皇帝。鄭泰和城門校尉伍瓊、董卓長史何顒和尚書周毖被董卓任命去選拔天下名士為官。後鄭泰與伍瓊、何顒等勸董卓讓袁紹擔任渤海太守，用以籠絡他，但其實是想扶植袁紹作反董卓力量的源頭。 初平元年（190年）正月，袁紹自號車騎將軍，作為關東聯軍的盟主並起兵討伐董卓，董卓即與眾大臣會議，打算領兵對抗討伐軍。當時眾臣都不敢反對，而鄭泰擔心董卓軍隊兵多，強悍難制，於是出言反對出兵，董卓不悅，鄭泰於是再解釋反對出兵的原因實在是關東諸將根本無必要勞動大軍對付，並指出十點，包括人民安逸已久，已無戰意；董卓熟悉軍事，名振當時，足以令人懾服和關東諸將全都不是軍旅之才，對陣根本不是董卓的對手等，勸說董卓不要出大軍。董卓聽從，於是讓鄭泰為將軍，統率諸軍對抗討伐軍。及後有人向董卓說鄭泰智略過人，其實暗中與敵人合謀，給他兵馬就是讓他交給其同黨。董卓於是收回鄭泰兵權，改拜議郎。 其後，董卓見關東討伐軍兵多，感到恐懼，於是決心遷都，於三月正式將都城遷至長安。而當時天下大亂，又有飢荒，士大夫很多都不能生活，而因鄭泰有錢，每日都舉行聚會，藉此救濟了很多人。後鄭泰與荀攸和何顒等合謀暗殺董卓，但秘密洩漏，鄭泰從武關逃離長安，投奔後將軍袁術，袁術則上表鄭泰為揚州刺史。鄭泰於上任的路上去世，享年四十一歲。 [在维基数据编辑],"A man from a wealthy family, known for his intelligence and strategic mind, lived in a region of a vast empire during a time of political turmoil. As a young man, he foresaw the impending chaos and secretly allied himself with influential figures. Despite his wealth and extensive land holdings, he often faced shortages, yet his reputation spread far and wide.  He was eventually recommended for a prestigious position but initially declined. When the emperor passed away, a new ruler ascended the throne, and a powerful general took charge of the government. This general appointed the man to a high-ranking position and plotted to eliminate corrupt officials, planning to summon a notorious warlord to assist. The man warned against this, citing the warlord's ambition and potential threat to the government, but his advice was ignored, leading him to resign.  Later, the corrupt officials discovered the general's plot and killed him. The warlord then seized control, causing further chaos. The man, along with others, was tasked with selecting officials for the government. He and his allies secretly supported a rival leader to counter the warlord's power.  As tensions rose, the rival leader declared himself a military commander and led a coalition against the warlord. The man advised against direct military confrontation, arguing that the coalition was not a match for the warlord's forces. The warlord initially heeded this advice, appointing the man as a general. However, suspicions arose about the man's loyalty, leading to his demotion.  Fearing the growing strength of the coalition, the warlord decided to relocate the capital. Amidst widespread chaos and famine, the man used his resources to aid many in need. He later conspired with others to assassinate the warlord, but the plan was exposed. Fleeing to join another military leader, he was appointed to a regional governorship but died on his journey, at the age of forty-one.","The individual's life story closely resembles that of Cao Cao, a prominent figure during the late Eastern Han dynasty in China.

The narrative of advising against summoning a warlord, facing shortages despite wealth, and ultimately conspiring against a powerful warlord aligns with Cao Cao's historical actions and his complex relationship with other warlords and officials of the time."
郑泰,no,Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong),,https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%84%AD%E6%B3%B0_(%E6%98%8E%E6%9C%9D),"鄭泰（1612年—1663年），鄭芝龍的堂侄，鄭成功的堂兄，與鄭成功同為鄭氏十二世，並長期擔任戶官，管理財務及對外貿易。隆武帝曾封鄭泰為建平侯。鄭泰事件爆發後，鄭泰遭鄭經軟禁，親人投奔滿清，鄭泰自盡。 當鄭成功帶兵出征時，鄭泰經常留守根據地。例如： 1662年（永曆16年，清康熙元年），鄭成功打敗東印度公司，攻占臺灣。世子鄭經居廈門，和其弟的乳母陳昭娘私通生子，鄭成功大怒，要殺陳昭娘，鄭經卻保護了昭娘。鄭成功更怒，命洪旭等諸將殺鄭經和鄭經的母親董氏，洪旭認為此處分太過嚴重，請示鄭泰之後並未執行此令，廈門與臺灣兩岸緊張。同年，鄭成功去世，鄭襲在臺灣自立為王，後來鄭經克臺，打敗了叔父鄭襲，在台灣嗣位。 1663年（永曆17年），鄭經懷疑鄭泰和擁護叔父鄭襲的大臣黃昭有所勾結，想要整肅鄭泰的勢力。鄭經先封鄭泰為金廈總制，假意要把金門和廈門都交給鄭泰，接著鄭經請鄭泰赴宴並趁機將鄭泰軟禁起來。當晚鄭泰之弟鄭鳴駿和兒子鄭纘緒等人懼禍帶著軍艦五百艘和水手八千餘人投降清朝，鄭泰聞訊後自縊身亡。 鄭成功北伐失敗之後，鄭泰對明鄭事業失去信心，開始把資金匯到日本，以備萬一，寄存在日本長崎唐通事辦事處。（根據郭弘斌著的《台灣人的台灣史》，寄銀總共307,032兩3錢4分，亦即丁銀3,070貫323匁4分。然而《閩海紀要》所記載的這個數據是40萬）這件事鄭成功、鄭經父子都不知道。一直到鄭泰死後，鄭經派人細查帳冊才發現。 從1663年（明永曆17年、清康熙2年、日寬文3年）開始，鄭經派協理刑官蔡政到日本，向日方要求歸還這筆錢。但是鄭泰的弟弟鄭鳴駿也派人到日本要求歸還，而且還持有存銀勘合。日本受理雙方訴訟後，表示僅以雙方的提訴理由不能決定，要求雙方提出充分證據。 此後，1664、1665、1666年，鄭經和鄭泰親族都各派代表到長崎交涉。到1674年，日本決定將存銀交給鄭泰遺族。但是此時中國正發生三藩之亂，在北京的鄭泰遺族被滿人控制，行動並不能自主，想要再歸屬鄭經，於是派人前往廈門拜會鄭經，以存銀勘合為條件請降，鄭經答應。 1675年，鄭經派員往日本拿回存銀。原本的30萬兩白銀，日本扣開支銷（部分是因為1663年的一場大火燒黑或燒鎔成塊），只發回26萬。 這一項索回寄銀的事件，前後12年，鄭經方面派人交涉4次，鄭泰遺族則有6次。","A man born in the early 1600s, a relative of a prominent leader, held a significant position managing finances and trade. He was once granted a noble title by an emperor. After a major incident, he was placed under house arrest by a family member, leading to his demise. During military campaigns, he often stayed behind to manage the base. In a notable year, a leader defeated a foreign company and took control of an island. Tensions arose when a family member had an affair, leading to a conflict that was not fully executed due to its severity. The leader passed away, and another family member took control of the island, eventually defeating an uncle to claim leadership.  The following year, suspicions arose about the man's connections with a minister, leading to a plan to diminish his influence. He was given a title and invited to a feast, where he was detained. That night, his brother and son fled with a fleet to another power, and upon hearing this, the man took his own life. After a failed northern campaign, he lost faith in the cause and began transferring funds to another country for safekeeping, unbeknownst to his family. It was only after his death that the funds were discovered.  Starting in the mid-1600s, a family member sent an official to the foreign country to reclaim the funds. However, the man's brother also made a claim, holding a certificate. The foreign country required evidence from both parties. Over the next few years, representatives from both sides negotiated. Eventually, the foreign country decided to return the funds to the man's family. However, due to ongoing conflicts in their homeland, the family, under foreign control, sought to rejoin the original family member, using the funds as leverage. The family member agreed.  In the late 1600s, an envoy was sent to retrieve the funds. Originally, a large sum was stored, but due to expenses and damages from a fire, only a portion was returned. This process took over a decade, with multiple negotiations from both sides.","The story closely aligns with the life of Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong), a Ming loyalist who fought against the Qing dynasty. He was a prominent figure in the 17th century, known for his naval campaigns and control over Taiwan. The narrative of a family member taking control of an island and defeating an uncle to claim leadership mirrors Koxinga's actions in Taiwan. The tensions and conflicts within the family, as well as the financial dealings with a foreign country, are reminiscent of the complex political and familial dynamics during Koxinga's time. The mention of a noble title, house arrest, and eventual suicide also aligns with the fate of Koxinga's father, Zheng Zhilong, who was executed by the Qing. The financial negotiations and retrieval of funds from a foreign country further suggest the historical context of Koxinga's interactions with foreign powers."

陈宫,yes,Guan Yu,"Chen Gong was a military strategist and advisor during the late Eastern Han dynasty in China, known for initially serving Cao Cao before defecting to Lü Bu.",https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%99%88%E5%AE%AB,陳宮（2世纪—199年2月7日），字公臺，兗州東郡武陽縣（位於山東省與河南省之間）人，剛直烈壯，年少與海內知名之士皆連結。東漢末年天下大亂，為曹操的麾下，後叛投到呂布帳下。為呂布出謀獻策。呂布死亡後，拒絕向曹操投降，而被曹操揮淚絞刑。 陳宮是兗州東郡武陽縣（位於山東省與河南省之間）人，年少時與海內知名之士認識，當時董卓廢劉辯為弘農王而立漢獻帝導致天下大亂時，便加入曹操義兵陣營。。小说《三國演義》則以陈宫是东汉末年中牟县县令，捕获被通缉的曹操，却弃官随其私逃。 初平三年（192年），青州的百萬黃巾军入侵了兗州，轉入東平縣。兗州刺史劉岱想要攻打黃巾黨，濟北相鮑信勸他最好固守。劉岱不聽鮑信的勸告，與黃巾黨交戰，兵敗被殺。 劉岱既死，陳宮劝說曹操：「兗州今無主，我自请去兖州游說，让他们找你做州牧。你可以凭借此处征服天下，成就霸王之業。」陳宮到了兗州后游说別駕、治中等人：「今天下分裂而兗州無主。曹操是天下的大才，若把他迎接来做州牧，必能给百姓带来太平。」鮑信等同意。鮑信乃與州吏萬潛等至東郡迎曹操領兗州牧。曹操赴任后出兵擊黃巾于壽張東面。鮑信力戰而死。曹操击败黃巾，追击残敌至濟北。受降卒三十餘萬，男女百餘萬口，收其精銳者整军，號為“青州兵”。 興平元年（194年），曹操東征徐州陶謙，使程昱與荀彧留守鄄城，其將領陳宮屯東郡。陳宮與從事中郎許汜、王楷共謀反叛曹操，陳宮說服張邈：「今天下分崩，雄桀並起，君擁十萬之眾，當四戰之地，撫劒顧眄，亦足以為人豪，而反受制，不以鄙乎！今曹操東征，其處空虛，呂布壯士，善戰無前，迎之共據兗州，觀天下形埶，俟時事變通，此亦從橫一時也。」張邈與弟張超及陳宮等迎呂布為兗州牧，據濮陽，郡縣皆應。 呂布至，張邈使劉翊告荀彧：「呂布來助曹操擊陶謙，緊需請求軍糧。」眾疑惑。荀彧知張邈為叛亂，即緊守兵馬，急召東郡太守夏侯惇，而兗州諸城皆應呂布。時曹操大軍攻陶謙，留守兵少，而諸將多與張邈、陳宮通謀。夏侯惇至，其夜誅謀叛者數十人，眾乃定。豫州刺史郭貢率眾數萬來至城下，或言與呂布同謀，眾甚懼。郭貢求見荀彧，荀彧將往。夏侯惇等曰：「君一州鎮守，往必危險，不可。」荀彧則表示：「郭貢與張邈等，分非素結也，今來速，計必未定；及其未定說之，縱不為用，可使中立，若先疑之，彼將怒而成計。」郭貢見荀彧無懼意，認為鄄城難攻而退兵。 呂布軍降者，言陳宮取東阿，又使氾嶷取范，吏民皆恐。彧謂程昱曰：「今兗州反，唯有此三城。陳宮等以重兵臨之，非有以深結其心，三城必動。君，民之望也，歸而說之，殆可！」程昱乃歸，過范，說其令靳允：「聞呂布執君母弟妻子，孝子誠不可為心！今天下大亂，英雄並起，必有命世，能息天下之亂者，此智者所詳擇也。得主者昌，失主者亡。陳宮叛迎呂布而百城皆應，似能有為，然以君觀之，布何如人哉！夫布，粗中少親，剛而無禮，匹夫之雄耳。陳宮等以勢假合，不能相君也。兵雖眾，終必無成。曹操智略不世出，殆天所授！君必固范，我守東阿，則田單之功可立也。孰與違忠從惡而母子俱亡乎？唯君詳慮之！」靳允流涕：「不敢有二心。」時氾嶷已在縣，靳允伏兵刺殺氾嶷，歸勒允兵守。程昱又遣別騎絕倉亭津，陳宮至，不得渡。程昱至東阿，東阿令棗祗已率厲吏民，拒城堅守。又兗州從事薛悌與程昱協謀，终于堅守三城，以待曹操。 曹操引軍從東還，呂布攻鄄城不能下，西屯濮陽。曹操認為：「呂布一旦得一州，不能據東平，斷亢父、泰山之道乘險要我，而屯濮陽，我知其無能。」遂進軍攻之。布出兵戰，先以騎犯青州兵。青州兵奔，曹操陣亂，馳突火出，墜馬，燒左手掌。司馬樓異扶曹操上馬，遂引去。未至營止，諸將未與曹操相見，皆恐懼。曹操親自勞軍，令軍中準備攻城器具，再次進攻，與呂布攻守百餘日。蝗蟲起，糧食缺乏，引發吃人事件，呂布糧食亦盡，各引軍去。呂布東屯山陽。 荀彧向曹操表示：「昔日劉邦保關中，劉秀據河內，皆深根固本以制天下，進足以勝敵，退足以堅守，故雖有困敗而終濟大業。將軍本以兗州首事，平山東之難，百姓無不歸心悅服。且河、濟，天下之要地也，今雖殘壞，猶易以自保，是亦將軍之關中、河內也，不可以不先定。今以破李封、薛蘭，若分兵東擊陳宮，陳宮必不敢西顧，以其閒勒兵收熟麥，約食畜穀，一舉而呂布可破也。破呂布，然後南結揚州，共討袁術，以臨淮、泗。若舍呂布而東征徐州，多留兵則不足用，少留兵則民皆保城，不得樵採。布乘虛寇暴，民心益危，唯鄄城、范、衞可全，其餘非己之有，是無兗州也。若徐州不定，將軍當安所歸乎？且陶謙雖死，徐州未易亡也。彼懲往年之敗，將懼而結親，相為表裏。今東方皆以收麥，必堅壁清野以待將軍，將軍攻之不拔，略之無獲，不出十日，則十萬之眾未戰而自困耳。前討徐州，威罰實行，其子弟念父兄之恥，必人自為守，無降心，就能破之，尚不可有也。夫事固有棄此取彼者，以大易小可也，以安易危可也，權一時之勢，不患本之不固可也。今三者莫利，願將軍熟慮之。」曹操乃止。大收麥，復與呂布戰，二年間，曹操盡復收諸城，擊破呂布于鉅野。呂布敗走東奔劉備。兗州遂平。 建安元年（196年）六月，呂布部將郝萌發動叛亂，攻擊下邳府的廳事閤，呂布驚慌中全身赤裸裸急忙和某女子突破廁所的牆壁脫逃，到都督高順的營內，高順讓出督將位子給呂布。高順詢問呂布有沒有什麼可以依靠用來判斷敵人的線索，呂布只回答聽到河內人的話，高順判斷出敵人是郝萌，並且立即帶兵進入下邳府，斬殺郝萌，平定叛亂。事件結束後，呂布詢問曹性事情的起源，曹性答：「郝萌受袁術的鼓動而造反。」呂布又問：「有誰同謀嗎？」曹性回答說陳宮就是同謀，當時陳宮就坐在呂布旁臉發紅，呂布以陳宮為大將為由並不追究，後讓曹性統領郝萌餘部。 建安三年（198年）冬，曹操軍隊圍攻下邳時，曾獻計以呂布屯兵城外，與下邳互為犄角，本來呂布答應，但呂布在妻子的建言下而不採納。三月後（十二月，199年），呂布軍心崩潰，部將侯成、魏續、宋憲叛變，縛其投降曹操。 當陳宮被縛，和曹操對話時，曹操問：「公臺你每次說你自己智計有餘，現在如何？」陳宮直指呂布：「就是這個人不聽我諫言才會有這下場，若聽我的，就不至於被捉了。」曹操一度勸他再度出仕自己，但陳宮不為所動，义正辞嚴地答道：“作為漢朝的臣子沒有報國盡忠，且作為人子沒有盡孝，理当一死。” 曹操再問起陳宮的母親、妻子及子女，陳宮以曹操的仁孝治政不會殘害家屬為由託付給曹操，並表明就死決心說：「请出就戮，以正军法。」隨即頭也不回的赴刑場就義而死，曹操泣而送之。陳宮與高順、呂布一起被縊殺，老母妻小一家由曹操所供養，侍從若有怠慢者，即斬殺之，陳宮女兒的婚事也為曹操安排。,"A man from a region between two provinces, known for his integrity and strength, was connected with many renowned individuals in his youth. During a period of great turmoil, he initially served under a powerful leader but later defected to join another warlord, offering strategic advice. After the warlord's death, he refused to surrender and was executed by his former leader, who wept at his demise.  In his early years, he was acquainted with many notable figures. When a tyrant deposed a young ruler, causing chaos, he joined a militia. In a particular year, a massive army invaded his region. The local governor wanted to attack, but his advisor suggested a defensive strategy. Ignoring this advice, the governor was defeated and killed. After the governor's death, the man advised his leader to take control of the region, which was without a ruler, to establish dominance. His leader accepted the proposal and was welcomed by local officials, eventually defeating the invading army and incorporating many into his forces.  In another year, while his leader was on a campaign, the man conspired with others to rebel. He persuaded a local official to join forces with a formidable warrior to seize control of the region. The warrior was welcomed, and many towns supported him. However, the leader's advisor, aware of the rebellion, fortified their position and summoned reinforcements. Despite the rebellion's initial success, the leader's forces eventually regained control.  The leader, recognizing the strategic importance of the region, decided to focus on consolidating power there rather than pursuing other campaigns. Over time, the leader's forces recaptured towns and defeated the warrior, who fled to another ally. The region was finally pacified.  In a later year, a general under the warrior's command rebelled, causing chaos. The warrior, caught off guard, sought refuge with a loyal officer who helped suppress the rebellion. Afterward, the warrior questioned the origins of the rebellion and learned of a conspiracy involving the man. Despite this, the warrior did not punish him, valuing his military expertise.  In a subsequent year, during a siege, the man advised the warrior to position troops strategically, but the warrior ignored this advice. Eventually, the warrior's forces were betrayed, leading to his capture. When the man was brought before his former leader, he was asked about his previous claims of wisdom. He blamed the warrior for not heeding his counsel. The leader offered him a position, but he refused, citing his failure to serve his country and family as reasons for accepting his fate. He entrusted his family to the leader's care, confident in the leader's benevolence, and faced execution with dignity. The leader mourned his death and ensured the man's family was well cared for, even arranging a marriage for his daughter.","The individual described in the summary appears to be Guan Yu, a famous general from the Three Kingdoms period in China. Guan Yu is known for his loyalty, integrity, and martial prowess. He initially served under the warlord Liu Bei but was captured and executed by Sun Quan's forces after refusing to surrender. His execution was mourned by his captor, which aligns with the narrative of the leader weeping at his demise. Guan Yu's life involved strategic military advice, loyalty to his leader, and a dignified acceptance of his fate, all of which are key elements in the provided summary."
法正,yes,Zhuge Liang,"Fa Zheng was a strategist and advisor during the Three Kingdoms period in China, serving under the warlord Liu Bei.",https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B3%95%E6%AD%A3,法正（176年—220年），字孝直。東漢司隸右扶風郿（今陕西眉县）人，三國時蜀漢重臣；深有謀略，定軍山之戰策劃襲殺夏侯淵。劉備在世時，惟獨法正有諡號，死後追諡為翼侯。與曹魏謀士程昱和郭嘉一樣有性格缺陷（程昱太剛直易得罪人、郭嘉行為不檢、法正則是睚眥必報），但同樣善策奇謀，故陳壽譽其可比二人。 法正出生于176年，他的祖父法真為當代名士。其家族為戰國時代田齊君主齊襄王田法章的後人。 建安初年，天下饥荒，法正与同郡孟达一同入蜀依附刘璋，多年後法正升為新都令，后召署军议校尉。但法正不受劉璋重用，又為其州邑僑客之人所诽谤，非常不得志。 益州别驾张松与法正相為友善，深覺劉璋不足以有所作為，常暗自歎息，無法施展才能。 建安十三年（208年），张松於荊州出使見曹操归来，勸說劉璋與曹操斷絕關係，而與劉備交好結盟。劉璋問：「誰可以作為使者？」張松乃舉薦法正，原本法正辭讓不願前往，因張松再三舉薦才前往。法正出使回來後，向張松說劉备有雄才大略，是值得效命的英主，於是兩人秘密達成奉戴劉備的共識，期望有朝一日能迎劉備入川蜀。 建安十六年（211年），劉璋聽聞曹操有滅漢中張魯之意而常懷畏懼之心，張松乘機勸劉璋應當恭迎邀請劉備入川蜀，讓劉備分擔抵禦張魯的責任，劉璋再次派遣法正為正使，與孟達為副使，率領四千人受命前往荊州。法正表面宣告來意，暗地里向劉備献策：「以將軍之命世英才，乘劉璋之懦弱无能；張松，益州裡的股肱人才，以为内应；然後以益州之殷富，凭天府之險阻，以此来成大业，易如反掌。」诸葛亮的三分天下之计须取荆州和益州二地，法正、张松倒戈实乃天赐良机。劉備聽從了法正的計策，領兵沿長江逆流而上，西進與劉璋相會於涪城。 建安十七年（212年），隨後劉備率軍北上葭萌，接著又率軍掉頭南返進攻劉璋。刘璋的部下谋士郑度向劉璋點出劉備軍糧草不足的問題以坚壁清野之策拖垮劉備，並进谏：「劉備領孤軍遠道而來進攻，百姓尚未向歸附劉備，全靠臨時徵集民間的糧草，軍隊嚴重缺乏物資輜重。對付他們最好的計策是把巴西、梓潼兩地的百姓全部驅趕遷往至涪水以西，把兩地農田裡、糧倉裡的糧草全部燒毀，我軍沿河岸修築城防深挖濠溝，鎮靜地等待他們的到來。他們來後，向我們挑戰，我們堅守不出，時間久了他們就會出現糧草供給不上的問題，不出百日，必定自行撤退。劉備軍一旦撤退，我軍進攻追擊，這樣即可生擒劉備。」劉備聽到消息後憂慮甚為忿恨，詢問法正如何應對。法正說：「劉璋不會採用鄭度的計策，不用擔心。」結果如法正所言，劉璋答：「我只聽說抗擊敵人保護百姓，從未聽說遷徙百姓來躲避敵人。」而拒絕鄭度這條計策，並將郑度免職。 建安十八年（213年），劉備進攻到雒城，派人召荊州兵馬諸葛亮、張飛、趙雲、劉封等人入蜀支援，法正去信給劉璋說：「法正我禀性缺乏才智，現在您與左將軍友好結盟受到損害，我擔心您身旁的人不明事情的來龍去脈，必定會把所有過錯都歸咎到我一人身上，使我終生蒙受恥辱，也使您連帶受辱，故而失身流落在外，不敢回去複命。怕您厭惡我的言語聲音，所以這期間也不敢向您寫信致意。回想起往日您對我的恩情，我常常翹首西望，心中極為悲傷惆悵；然而我考慮還是把事情的前因後果說清楚以披露自己的心跡。從事情的初始直到最終，我絕沒有隱瞞任何真情，有言不盡意表白不清之處，是我愚笨拙劣，誠意沒能將您打動，以致造成今天這種局面。現在國事危急，大禍臨頭，雖然我流落在外，張口就會增加您對我的怨恨，我覺得還是應該把心中要說的話說出來，以剖明自己的忠心。 將軍你的本心，我法正是了解的，實際是謹慎小心不願得罪左將軍，而最終還是引起矛盾，是因為您身邊的人不明白英雄處世從事的道理，以為可以違背信義誓約，憑著意氣辦事。他們長期以來，追求順耳悅目，阿諛奉承趨炎附勢，皆因他們缺乏遠慮不為國家作長遠打算。事變發生以後，他們又不能估量雙方勢力的強弱形勢，以為左將軍孤軍遠道而入，缺乏糧草儲備，故想以多擊少，曠日相持。而左將軍自白水關到此，所過郡縣全被攻破，將軍您所有的關口、營寨，日益孤立衰落。雒城雖有兵馬上萬，但都是敗陣之卒、破軍之將，如果打算憑此軍隊爭一時戰鬥的勝利，那麼兵將勢力確實不相當；打算長期相持來消耗左將軍的糧草也行不通，因為左將軍的營地已扎守堅固，糧草已有了積囤，而將軍您的地盤日益漸少，百姓日益困窮，敵對力量越來越多，軍需供應又被遠遠隔開。以臣愚見，真正糧草先竭、無法堅持長久的卻是將軍。照目前兩邊情況相持下去，將軍實難維持。現在張益德率領數万之眾，已平定巴東，進入犍為境界，並分兵平定江陽、德陽，安漢三路向前挺進，您如何抵擋得住？原來替將軍謀劃的人，肯定說左將軍是孤軍遠來而缺乏糧草，運送不及，而且兵少無援。如今荊州入蜀的道路已被開通，左將軍的軍隊比原來增強幾十倍，還有孫權將軍已派遣他的弟弟及李異、甘寧等領兵做後援。比較主客雙方的形勢變化，如果您想憑土地廣大來取勝，而今對方已完全佔領了巴東，廣漢、犍為也大半被攻占，巴西又非將軍所有了。計算起來益州所能憑依的只有蜀郡，而蜀郡已經不復完整，川蜀土地已三分失二，官吏百姓已疲憊不堪，每十戶人家就有八戶企圖起來作亂。如果敵軍離得遠則百姓忍受不了長久的勞役，敵軍進逼近則他們就會投降反叛。廣漢各郡縣就是明證。 此外魚腹（今重慶市永安鎮奉節縣）與白水關（今廣元市青川縣營盤鄉五里埡），一是東沿水路長江取魚腹（奉節）可入蜀，二是北從陸路取（關頭）白水關亦可入蜀。因而守住魚腹、關頭是福，失掉魚腹、關頭必然有禍。實在是決定益州禍福成敗的門戶，如今兩道門戶已被打開，堅固的城池皆被攻破，各路軍隊都被擊敗，能戰的兵將已損失殆盡，而敵軍幾路進擊，已攻入益州的心腹之地，而您僅能困守成都、雒城二地，誰存誰亡的局勢，昭然可見。這只是大致情形，比較明顯易見，至於其餘曲折隱伏的因素，就難以用文字表述清楚了。像我法正這種下愚之人，尚且明白如此局面再難扭轉，何況將軍您身旁聰明多智的謀士，豈能不明白事情的必然後果？他們靠暫時的苟且僥倖，乞求容身，獻媚邀寵，不作長久打算，不肯盡心獻上良策。如果事情危急大勢已去，他們將各自謀生逃命，保全自家門戶，調身轉背，就會作出與現在完全不同的打算，絕不會為將軍您盡忠死節，反過來您的家口還會受到他們帶來的憂患。我法正雖已蒙受不忠的誹謗，但捫心自問我並未有負于您的恩德，顧念我們之間的君臣名分義務，我實在為將軍疾首痛心。左將軍為了國家的根本利益而舉兵前來，對您的舊情依在，並無敵意，我竊以為您可以根據事情的變化而改變策略，以便保全自己的家族。」 建安十九年（214年），刘备军包围成都，蜀郡太守许靖欲棄城逃亡。事情敗露並未成功。劉璋因成都即將陷落，故沒有處決許靖。劉璋投降後，劉備因許靖背主之事而看不起許靖，對他不加任用。法正勸劉備說：「天下有的是博得虛名而無真正德才之人，像許靖即是如此。但是主公大業方興，許靖的名聲是四海之內皆知，如果對他不能待之以禮，天下之人則會因此說主公在輕賢慢士。所以對許靖應該敬重以待，以此昭示遠近，您是在追效戰國燕昭王厚待郭隗的作法。」於是劉備起用許靖，派任許靖官位高但無實權的職務。 攻下成都後，劉備佔據益州後便領益州牧，从此奠定了三国鼎立的基础。眼下當務之急是需與蜀中豪強結納關係，因此群臣勸劉備迎娶劉璋舊將吳懿之妹穆皇后吳氏，但吳氏是劉璋已故兄長劉瑁之妻，劉備認為自己與劉瑁同族，這麼做有違禮法。法正進諫道：「論其親疏，何與晉文之於子圉乎？」晉文公逃難到秦國時曾娶了親侄晉懷公子圉的妻子懷嬴。法正認為晉文公尚且可以娶親侄之妻而未遭到禮法的抨擊，何況於劉備與劉瑁之間還不是親戚關係。劉備遂納吳氏為夫人。其後，劉備賜予諸葛亮、法正、張飛及關羽四人黃金各五百斤，白銀千斤，錢五千萬，錦千匹，作為諸將中最高賞賜。法正被任命為蜀郡太守、揚武將軍。 建安十九年（214年），劉備命揚武將軍法正與軍師將軍諸葛亮、昭文將軍伊籍、左將軍西曹掾劉巴、興業將軍李嚴五人一起制定「以法治蜀」之律法《蜀科》。改變劉璋治下益州法紀鬆弛，德政不舉，威刑不肅的局面。然而法正雖然擅長軍事謀略，但在政治政見上稍差，但知因循守舊卻不會變通。《蜀科》制定後，由於嚴法治蜀，打擊了地方豪強勢力，豪強十分不滿，以消極態度牴觸蜀漢政權，為此，法正提出用當年漢高祖入關與民約法三章之事向諸葛亮進言，認為成都初定，宜緩刑弛禁，放寬約束。但諸葛亮認為不能盲目沿用漢初的法度，應當因時制宜，懂得變通，於是寫了封信《答法正書》給法正，曉以大義，告訴其更深一層的意思。 當時法正得勢，在外掌握著益州首府蜀郡的行政大權（蜀郡下轄成都縣），同時兼任地方官和首都的行政首長；在內為劉備出謀劃策，係劉備身邊的主要謀士。 然法正性格恩怨分明、睚眥必報。尤其在掌握大權後，曾給與滴水恩情的人均給予回報；反之，即便與其僅是有過小小矛盾，亦加以報復，擅殺毀傷己者數人。於是有人向諸葛亮告發，望他能稟報劉備，勿讓法正作威作福。然而諸葛亮深知法正乃深得寵信的肱股之臣，且勞苦功高，遂不上報。 建安二十年（215年），孫權知道劉備已奪得益州，希望取回荊州。劉備卻推託說：「當得到涼州時，便會把荊州給予。」孫權對此十分怨恨，便派呂蒙奪取長沙、零陵、桂陽三郡。鲁肃将万余人马于益阳牵制关羽，刘备从益州带兵回援。当时随从的军师为法正，后曹操南攻汉中，威慑蜀中，刘备便迅速和孙权修和，协议平分荆州，湘江以西的三郡南郡、零陵、武陵歸劉備，湘江以東的三郡江夏、桂陽、長沙則歸孫權，但双方关系已趋恶化。 建安二十二年（217年），法正認為曹操降伏張魯後卻未繼續進攻益州，反而留下夏侯淵、張郃駐守漢中，一定是內部動亂，眼下正是奪取漢中的最佳時機。 且告訴劉備奪取漢中的意義： 與曹軍在漢中作戰時形勢不利，本應馬上撤退，而劉備不肯，無人敢進諫。當時箭如雨下，法正見狀便站到劉備前面當肉盾擋箭，劉備急忙說：「法正快去避箭！」法正回：「連主公也甘冒箭雨身先士卒，何況我呢。」劉備只好下令撤退。 建安二十四年（219年），正月，劉備南渡沔水，於定軍山、興勢山山麓紮營，與率軍前來的夏侯渊部對峙。當時夏侯渊駐守南線據點走馬谷，張郃駐守東線據點廣石。法正採取聲東擊西之計，讓劉備將萬餘精兵分作十隊，趁夜輪番進攻廣石。張郃率親兵搏戰，雖然沒有丟失據點，但也抵擋不住劉備軍的輪番攻擊，於是向夏侯淵要求增援。夏侯淵將精兵分撥一半去支援張郃，自己繼續固守南線。隨後劉備派兵偷襲走馬谷，放火燒毀了曹軍陣地前的防衛工事鹿角，夏侯淵親自率四百軍士出營救火、修補鹿角。此時，法正看準時機，見夏侯淵正處於劣勢，提議全力進攻夏侯淵，劉備於是命黃忠居高山上奇襲臨下從後方擂鼓突襲，夏侯淵措手不及被黃忠斬殺，趙雲接應黃忠，將黃忠救出，曹軍潰敗。劉備從此奠定了漢中之戰的主動權。不久，曹操親臨戰綫，聽聞是法正獻計取漢中，因而感慨不已歎道：“吾故知玄德不辩有此，必為人所教也”，而後又說“天下賢士都被我所用，為何獨缺法正？”。接下來的漢中爭奪戰中，曹操雖然兵力佔有絕對優勢，但是劉備斂眾拒險，終不與曹操交鋒，曹操積月不拔，亡者日多。夏，曹操不得已而引軍北還，劉備遂領有漢中，效仿高祖漢王劉邦，劉備佔有漢中進位為漢中王，以法正為尚書令、護軍將軍。 在法正等人的輔佐下，劉備集團西取巴蜀、北收漢中，劉備進位漢中王，達到了勢力的頂峰。諸葛亮對此評價：“主公之在公安也，北畏曹公之強，東憚孫權之逼，近則懼孫夫人生變於肘腋之下；當斯之時，進退狼跋，法孝直為之輔翼，令翻然翱翔，不可復制。”翌年，即漢獻帝建安二十五年，建安二十四年十二月（已是公曆220年）關羽敗走麥城後，法正去世，享年45歲。劉備為他連日哭泣，諡號翼侯，讚譽法正生前深謀遠慮。賜關內侯給其子法邈，法邈的最高職位為至奉車都尉、漢陽太守。 劉備一稱帝便東征孫權欲奪回荊州、為關羽報仇，群臣大多進諫，皆不聽從。章武二年，大軍戰敗，退回白帝城。諸葛亮感歎：「倘若法孝直還活著，便能夠制止主上，使之不行東征；就算無法阻止主上，也不致於大敗而歸呀。」 法正深信「士為知己者死」，對於欣賞自己才華的主君劉備極為忠心，甚至不惜以身體為劉備阻擋箭雨，使劉備安然撤退。法正病逝後，劉備為他連日哭泣，數日間食不下嚥。 法正個性恩怨分明，得勢之後就算是請吃一餐的小恩也必報答，但對小小得罪或輕視自己的人也必施罪。 生平事迹与正史大体相当，是贤士法真孙子，张松之友。原为刘璋部属，与张松、孟达合谋献益州给刘备。在涪城大会上，与庞统一起策划刺杀刘璋的计划。伐蜀成功后，曾与诸葛亮讨论治法之事。后来任蜀郡太守时公报私仇，听闻诸葛亮向他人的解释后有所收敛。曹刘争汉中时，说服刘备亲征，又受诸葛亮之命助黄忠斩杀夏侯渊。刘备进位汉中王後，法正獲任命为尚书令。 [在维基数据编辑],"A strategist from a

孟达,no,Meng Da,,https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%AD%9F%E9%81%94,孟達（？—228年），字子敬，为避刘备叔父讳而改为子度，東漢司隶右扶风平陵人，漢末三国时期人物。 劉備入蜀时，刘璋派遣孟达和法正去迎接刘备，刘备命其驻守江陵，蜀平后为宜都太守。建安二十四年（219年），孟达从秭归北攻房陵，殺死房陵太守蒯祺（诸葛亮的姐夫），攻下房陵后继续进攻上庸，并和刘封会合于此地。关羽围樊城、襄阳时（樊城之戰），曾要求刘封和孟达派兵援助，但被刘封和孟达拒绝，关羽战败后，孟达因畏惧被治罪，再加上跟刘封不和，于是帶著部下郤揖投降曹魏。 孟达投降曹魏后，在曹丕时受到重用，为散骑常侍、建武将军，封平阳亭侯，曹丕还将房陵、上庸、西城三郡合为新城，命其擔任新城太守，委以西南之任，孟达且与桓阶和夏侯尚亲善，并曾与夏侯尚和徐晃一同攻打刘封。 曹丕死後，当时桓阶、夏侯尚都已去世，孟达因心不自安，在诸葛亮引诱下，企图歸蜀漢，孟达又与魏兴太守申仪有隙。诸葛亮为促使孟达起事，派郭模诈降，故意将孟达之事告诉申仪。司馬懿得申仪报信后，寫信安撫孟達，暗中遣軍進討。孟達得知事泄后本已决定起事，但因得司马懿信遲疑，又認為司馬氏率軍來討必定先启奏魏帝曹叡再作定夺，至少需要三十日方能抵達，自己届时城池必已坚固；然而當司馬懿不等魏帝命令就于八日內行軍一千二百里趕來時，完全打亂孟達的部署。後來司馬懿在十六日內破上庸，斬殺孟達（详见新城之乱）。 同时代，曹魏有個举荐涿郡太守王雄的安定太守孟达，从履历看與此孟达並不是同一人。 字子庆。諸葛亮發動第一次北伐時，身處魏國上庸的孟達意圖回歸蜀國，徐晃乃做為司馬懿的副將跟隨征討孟達，在城前叫陣時被孟達一箭射中額頭，回營後不治身死。 [在维基数据编辑],"Meng Da (?-228), styled Zi Jing, later changed to Zi Du, was a figure from the late Eastern Han and Three Kingdoms period. When Liu Bei entered Shu, Liu Zhang sent Meng Da and Fa Zheng to welcome him. Liu Bei stationed him at Jiangling, and after Shu was pacified, he became the governor of Yidu. In the 24th year of Jian'an (219), Meng Da attacked Fangling from Zigui, killing the governor Kuai Qi, and continued to Shangyong, where he joined forces with Liu Feng. When Guan Yu besieged Fancheng and Xiangyang, he requested reinforcements from Liu Feng and Meng Da, but they refused. After Guan Yu's defeat, Meng Da, fearing punishment and having conflicts with Liu Feng, defected to Cao Wei with his subordinates.   After defecting, Meng Da was valued by Cao Pi, becoming a Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary and General of the Establishment, and was granted the title of Marquis of Pingyang Pavilion. Cao Pi merged the three commanderies of Fangling, Shangyong, and Xicheng into a new city, appointing Meng Da as its governor, entrusting him with the southwest. Meng Da was on good terms with Huan Jie and Xiahou Shang and once attacked Liu Feng with Xiahou Shang and Xu Huang.   After Cao Pi's death, with Huan Jie and Xiahou Shang also deceased, Meng Da felt uneasy. Under Zhuge Liang's persuasion, he planned to return to Shu Han and had conflicts with the governor of Weixing, Shen Yi. To incite Meng Da to action, Zhuge Liang sent Guo Mo to feign surrender and deliberately informed Shen Yi of Meng Da's plans. Sima Yi, upon receiving Shen Yi's report, wrote to appease Meng Da while secretly dispatching troops. Meng Da, upon learning of the leak, initially decided to act but hesitated after receiving Sima Yi's letter, believing Sima Yi would first report to the Wei Emperor Cao Rui before taking action, which would take at least thirty days, by which time his defenses would be strong. However, Sima Yi, without waiting for the emperor's orders, marched 1,200 li in eight days, disrupting Meng Da's plans. Sima Yi then captured Shangyong in sixteen days and executed Meng Da (see the Rebellion of the New City for details).  At the same time, there was another Meng Da in Cao Wei, the governor of Anding, who recommended Wang Xiong as the governor of Zhuo Commandery, but they were not the same person. Styled Zi Qing, during Zhuge Liang's first Northern Expedition, Meng Da, stationed in Wei's Shangyong, intended to return to Shu. Xu Huang, serving as Sima Yi's deputy, followed to suppress Meng Da and was shot in the forehead by Meng Da during a confrontation, dying from his injuries after returning to camp.","The summary provided is a detailed account of Meng Da's life and actions during the Three Kingdoms period in China. Meng Da was a notable figure who initially served under Liu Bei but later defected to Cao Wei due to conflicts and fear of punishment. His story is marked by his strategic movements between the rival states of Shu Han and Cao Wei, his involvement in military campaigns, and his eventual downfall due to Sima Yi's swift military response. The mention of his defection, his roles under Cao Pi, and his eventual execution by Sima Yi are key events that identify him as Meng Da."
夏侯霸,yes,Lü Bu,"Xiahou Ba was a general of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period of China, who later defected to the rival state of Shu Han.",https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%8F%E4%BE%AF%E9%9C%B8,夏侯霸（188年前—259年或262年），字仲权，沛國譙縣（今安徽省亳州市）人；三国時期曹魏和蜀汉後期重要將領；曹魏將領夏侯渊次子，其母为曹操妻室丁氏的妹妹。司马懿發動高平陵之变后，夏侯霸投奔蜀汉，官至車騎將軍。曾隨姜維北伐，夏侯霸病逝后獲追諡，但諡號失考。 219年，夏侯霸的父亲夏侯渊拜征西将军镇守汉中，但在定军山之战与蜀汉军队交战时阵亡，夏侯霸經常誓要征討蜀漢報仇。 黄初年间（220年至226年），夏侯霸在曹魏官至偏將軍，封關內侯。 230年，魏國大舉伐蜀漢，曹真入子午道，招夏侯霸為先鋒。夏侯霸率军前進至興勢。蜀漢派兵攻打，夏侯霸亲自在阵前作战，直到获援軍救解。239年，魏明帝曹叡托孤于曹爽和司马懿，夏侯霸受到曹爽重用，後被任命为讨蜀护军、右将军，进封博昌亭侯。 247年，魏國的隴西、南安、金城、西平等地的羌人首領餓何、燒戈、伐同、蛾遮塞等相繼反叛，攻城圍邑，亦引來蜀漢方面姜維發動的北伐，涼州胡人首领治無戴也呼應反叛。夏侯霸当时督诸军屯兵於為翅，雍州刺史、前将军郭淮料定姜维必然攻打夏侯霸，于是先进兵沨中再转向南。姜維也恰如郭淮所料率軍攻打為翅的夏侯霸所部，正逢郭淮军到接应，姜維于是撤退。 249年，司马懿發動高平陵之变，斬殺执掌魏国大权的曹爽，曹爽的外弟、夏侯霸之侄征西将军夏侯玄从前线被調離，郭淮成為征西將軍；由於夏侯霸见到夏侯氏及曹家亲族被司马懿迫害而心不自安，加上他一直與郭淮不和，為了避禍遂逃入蜀汉，但在陰平迷失了道路，糧盡遇困。蜀汉得知後派人迎接。 由於早在五十年前的建安五年（200年），夏侯霸的从妹外出打柴时被张飞发现，张飞娶其为妻，生下的女儿成为了後主刘禅的皇后。因此當劉禪召见夏侯霸时宽慰他说：“你父親是死于亂軍之中，并不是由我父辈親手所殺。”又指着自己的儿子说：“这也是你夏侯氏的子侄。（张飞娶了夏侯渊的侄女--即夏侯霸的從妹夏侯氏，夏侯氏為張飛生了兩個女兒，刘禅又分別娶了張飛的兩個女兒，所以刘禅的子嗣是夏侯霸的表亲，按輩份劉禪還要叫夏侯霸為舅舅）”于是夏侯霸留在蜀汉受到重用。而夏侯霸留在曹魏的儿子因先祖夏侯渊以前的功勋受到特赦，未被追究父亲投敌之罪，但被流放到了偏远的乐浪郡（今朝鮮半島平壤）。 夏侯霸归降之后，蜀汉主将姜维问他魏国的政事，夏侯霸认为司马懿刚刚夺取政权，內部還未穩定尚无暇对外用兵，但他特别指出魏国若重用钟会將会成为蜀汉、东吴之患。 此后夏侯霸曾多次参与姜维对曹魏的战事，任至车骑将军。255年，姜維與夏侯霸出狄道，大破王經于洮西，王經退守狄道城，後陳泰派兵解圍。 《元和姓纂四校记》卷七称夏侯霸官至雍州牧，封郿侯。 夏侯霸身份特殊，同时是蜀汉、曹魏两大政權的皇族亲属，又因作為曹魏貴胄身份，在高平陵案中得罪了政變成功並在日後創立晉朝的司馬氏，故《三国志》作者陈寿基於政治考量对其记述的正文不足五十字，连其在蜀汉的封爵与谥号都没有记录。 另外，夏侯霸似乎亦有文才，在《隋書·經籍志·別集》、《新唐書·藝文志·集錄·別集類》等均有載錄「征北將軍夏侯覇集二卷」，其作品集與不少三國魏晉名士並齊。 夏侯霸到蜀地時，曾與當地名將張嶷提出交友請求，但張嶷以“不知彼此”為由而延緩，此事成為一時美談。 根据夏侯霸从妹的年龄推断，夏侯霸本人最晚出生于188年之前。《三国志·夏侯渊传》裴注引《魏略》：“初，建安五年（200年），时霸从妹年十三四，在本郡，出行樵采，为张飞所得。飞知其良家女，遂以为妻，产息女，为刘禅皇后。”古人以虚岁论，故夏侯霸这个族妹出生于186年至188年之间。 根據《三國志·蜀志·邓张宗杨传第十五》，夏侯霸的前任車騎將軍鄧芝在251年逝世，《資治通鑒》于255年時還有夏侯霸的事迹，而張翼與廖化則在259年分別擔任左右車騎將軍。另外，按照《三国志·关张马黄赵传》夏侯霸获谥在景耀三年（260年），且在后主追谥关羽、张飞等将之前。（詳見三國得諡者列表#蜀漢） 小说《三国演义》改编夏侯霸为夏侯渊的长子而非次子，因此表字「仲權」亦與「伯仲叔季」概念衝突。嘉靖本長坂坡之戰時被張飛喝死的「夏侯霸」為重名虛構人物，該角色在毛版（通行本）名為「夏侯傑」。 夏侯霸弓馬嫻熟，由曹爽推舉的心腹部將，多次抵禦蜀漢的侵擾。在征伐遼東公孫淵時，不到數回合砍掉遼東大將軍卑衍，遼東軍大亂。後來司馬懿政變，曹爽被殺，夏侯玄被調離，夏侯霸看出司馬懿的野心，遂起兵造反，打敗郭淮，在追擊逃跑的郭淮時，陳泰趕至，二人前後夾擊夏侯霸，夏侯霸兵敗，走投無路不得已降蜀，夏侯霸投蜀時已經是一個年華老去的將領。夏侯霸在蜀時追隨姜維北伐，曾提醒姜維必須提防鄧艾與鍾會兩人，姜維卻認為此兩人「量此孺子，何足道哉！」；曾不到十回合打敗郭淮救出姜維，最终卻在洮陽之戰中鄧艾伏擊被射殺。 [在维基数据编辑],"A military leader from the ancient era, born in a small village, played a significant role during the turbulent times of two rival kingdoms.

商輅,no,Zhuge Liang,,https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%95%86%E8%BC%85,商輅（1414年3月16日—1486年8月17日），字弘載，號素庵，一作素菴，谥文毅，浙江淳安人，祖籍河南開封，明朝政治人物。宣德乙卯解元，正統乙丑連中會元、狀元。官至吏部尚書、謹身殿大學士。 永樂十二年（1414年）二月二十五日出生。家贫，父祖皆不仕，祖父是獵户和樵夫，父亲在严州府衙充役小吏。商輅早年即為學諭王瑞所器重，宣德十年（1435年）舉鄉試第一，後來屢試不中，遂在太學潛心讀書十年，深受國子監祭酒李時勉賞識，于正統十年（1445年）舉會試第一，繼而殿試第一，三元及第，在明代只有被朱棣除名的黄观（黄觀為連中三元）和他有此殊榮。商輅及第后，除翰林院修撰，與劉儼等十人進學東閣。土木之變後，郕王監國，以陳循、高谷舉薦，進入內閣參贊機務。徐珵曾建議遷都，商輅則力阻。同年冬，進翰林院侍讀。 景泰元年（1450年）遣迎太上皇於居庸關，晋升學士。景泰三年（1452年）錦衣衛指揮使盧忠舉告太監阮浪、內使王瑤意圖扶植太上皇復位，明代宗大怒，逮捕兩人下詔獄。後來盧忠找同寅占卜，同寅告訴他：“這是不吉利的兆象，即使一死也無法化解。”盧忠因恐懼裝瘋。商輅進言稱其不足信，於是盧忠一併下獄，後以他罪連坐降為事官，王瑤被殺，阮浪被囚。景泰五年（1454）代宗易儲，后晋升商輅為兵部左侍郎，兼任左春坊大學士。當時河南饑荒，商輅請墾荒給糧。之後，鐘同、章綸下獄，均由商輅力救得免。《寰宇通誌》成，加兼太常寺卿。 景泰七年（1456年）代宗病重，群臣請建東宮，不予批准。商輅繼奏稱：「陛下宣宗章皇帝之子，當立章皇帝子孫。」聞者感動。因為日暮，奏未入，而同夜石亨等人已迎復上皇復位。此日，王文、于謙等被收拿，召商輅與高谷入殿，让他们起草復位詔书。石亨私下請其增加條款，遭到商輅拒絕。石亨不悅，命言官彈劾商輅，商輅於是下獄。商輅自訴《復儲疏》在禮部，可以覆驗，沒有得到回覆。當時中官興安稍微解釋，英宗更加震怒，興安則稱：「向者此輩創議南遷，不審置陛下何地。」英宗稍解，於是改釋商輅為民。後來，英宗常自言自語道：「輅，朕所取士，嘗與姚夔侍東宮」，不忍棄之。但因忌恨者多，竟不敢復用。 成化三年（1467年）明憲宗召商輅入京，恢復其內閣官職。商輅疏辭，憲宗稱：「先帝已知卿枉，其勿辭。」商輅於是進言陳勤學、納諫、儲將、防邊、省冗官、設社倉、崇先聖號、廣造士法凡八事。得到憲宗嘉獎採納，而當時羅倫、孔公恂等均恢復官職。 次年，天有彗星，给事中董旻、御史胡深等弹劾朝中不稱職的大臣，言及商輅。御史林誠詆毀其曾經參與易儲，不宜用，憲宗不聽。商輅因此求罷免，憲宗大怒，命朝廷逮捕言官，并欲加重譴。商輅則稱：“當時我曾經請陛下寬待言官，現在又指責他們，恐不公允。”憲宗欣慰，只是廷杖董旻幾人后恢復官職。之後，商輅進兵部尚書。久之，改戶部尚書。《宋元通鑒綱目》成，改兼文淵閣大學士。皇太子立，加太子少保，進吏部尚書。成化十三年（1477年）進謹身殿大學士。 商輅為人平粹簡重，寬厚有容，大事決議均毅然莫能奪。仁壽太后莊戶與民爭田，明憲宗欲徙民至塞外。商輅稱：「天子以天下為家，安用皇莊為？」此事方息。乾清宮門起火，工部請派人在四川、湖廣地區采木，商輅請少緩，得到批准。悼恭太子去世后，明憲宗因繼嗣為憂。當時紀氏生皇子朱祐樘，已經六歲，但左右內臣均畏懼萬貴妃而不敢言。之後，张敏告訴憲宗，憲宗大喜，欲宣示外廷，遣中官至內閣諭意。商輅請敕禮部擬上皇子名，於是廷臣相率稱賀。憲宗命朱祐樘見廷臣。即日后，憲宗抵文華殿，命朱祐樘侍，召見商輅及各位內閣大臣。商輅頓首請立皇太子，使得安中外心。明憲宗點頭同意。同年冬，遂立朱祐樘為皇太子。當時，憲宗召見皇子留在宮中，而其母紀氏仍在西內。商輅擔心萬貴妃加害紀氏，卻又難以直言，於是和同官上疏稱，皇子母子亦就近居住，而請紀氏遷入西六宮、永壽宮，封紀氏為妃。又過一個月，紀妃病終。商輅亦請禮宜從厚，并命司禮監奉皇子、問視、制衰服行禮。 當時，憲宗欲恢復郕王位號，命廷臣商議。商輅極言明景帝有社稷功，應當恢復位號，憲宗於是意決。憲宗還在建玉皇閣於皇宮之北，命內臣執事，禮與郊祀等，商輅則請罷免。此外，太監汪直掌管西廠，屢次製造冤案。商輅率領同官陳十一罪，與憲宗對抗。之後商輅亦說服內閣大臣萬安、劉珝、劉吉等內閣重臣，加上九卿項忠等亦彈劾汪直，當日罷黜西廠。雖然汪直不再掌管西廠，但仍然受寵，遂誣陷商輅收授指揮楊曄賄賂，而御史戴縉再次歌頌汪直功勞，請恢復西廠，商輅於是力求離去。后詔加少保，賜敕馳傳歸。商輅既去，士大夫更加俯首侍奉汪直，沒有再敢與之抗者了。 商輅為人坦蕩。錢溥曾經因為不能升遷，而作《禿婦傳》以譏諷商輅；高瑤請恢復明景帝位號，黎淳疏駁，極為詆毀商輅，商輅則均不計較，仍然待于如平日。萬貴妃重視其名，曾經遺金帛甚厚，商輅均力辭，稱：「非上命，不敢承也。」使者告訴萬貴妃，萬氏不悅，商輅此後歸鄉終不再起用。其回鄉后，劉吉路過其家，見其子孫人丁興旺，嘆道：“我劉吉與您共事多年，未曾見您筆下妄殺一人，現在是上天回報您的寬厚啊。”商輅稱：“我只是不敢讓朝廷妄殺一人而已。”十年后，成化二十二年（1486年）七月十八日卒。贈太傅，謚文毅。 商輅善書法，但傳世墨跡甚少。著有《商文毅疏稿略》、《商文毅公集》、《蔗山筆塵》，並纂有《續宋元資治通鑑綱目》二十七卷。 商輅與老師洪士直共同在學舍休憩住宿時，夢見一人提著三顆頭，並交與給他。商輅夢醒後，便把夢境中的情節告訴老師，洪說：“這是個好夢啊”後來商輅果真三元及第。 明代沈受先著有《商輅三元記》，後成為豫劇、越劇、台灣歌仔戲等各地戲曲，以及鼓曲、評彈、台灣唸歌等說唱藝術的表演題材。 [在维基数据编辑],"A person born in a small village in the early 15th century rose to prominence as a political figure in a distant empire.

刘琨,yes,Cao Cao,"Liu Kun was a Chinese military general and poet during the Western Jin dynasty, known for his loyalty and efforts to defend northern China against nomadic invasions.",https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%88%98%E7%90%A8,刘琨（270年—318年6月22日），字越石，中山郡魏昌县（今河北省石家庄市无极县）人，西晋末年、十六国时期政治家、文学家、音乐家、军事家，他曾经在西晋末年于晋阳（今山西太原）堅守了近十年，对抗劉淵和石勒等反晉勢力。官至司空、并州刺史、都督并冀幽三州諸軍事、侍中、太尉，封廣武侯，謚曰湣。 刘琨是西汉中山靖王刘胜之后，其祖父刘迈官至相国参军、散骑常侍，父亲刘蕃、胞兄刘舆也曾出任高官，舅舅是尚书郭奕。王敦也很欣賞刘琨。但同时他也喜好奢靡虚浮的清谈风流，是以大富豪石崇为首的“二十四友”的成员。 刘琨和祖逖一起担任司州主簿时，两人感情很好，常一起睡在同一张床上。有一天深夜，祖逖听到野鸡的叫声，把刘琨踢醒，说：“此非恶声也”。于是，两人都起床舞剑。刘琨和祖逖都有着远大的抱负，经常谈论世间事务，有时在深夜起床坐着，相互勉励：“若四海鼎沸，豪杰并起，吾与足下当相避于中原耳”。 后来，刘琨听说祖逖被东晋朝廷重用，在写给亲人故友的信中写道：“吾枕戈待旦，志枭逆虏，常恐祖生先吾着鞭”。 八王之乱中刘琨也被卷入。永康元年（300年）被其姐夫司马荂的父亲赵王司马伦重用。次年司马伦称帝，刘琨任太子詹事，辅佐司马荂。齐王司马冏、成都王司马颖、河间王司马颙等诸王讨伐司马伦。司马伦任命刘琨为冠军将军、假节。刘琨与司马伦手下孙秀领兵三万抵抗司马颖兵败。司马伦兵败之后司马冏辅政，因为刘琨出身名门，任命刘琨为尚书左丞，转司徒左长史。再次年司马冏败给东海王司马越，司马越的支持者范阳王司马虓（不是八王之一）镇守许昌，推荐刘琨为司马。 司马越派刘琨的父亲刘蕃为淮北护军、豫州刺史。河间王司马颙手下刘乔攻击司马虓，刘琨援救不及，其父母被刘乔俘获。刘琨说服其连襟溫憺的兄长冀州刺史温羡让位给司马虓。光熙元年（306年）从王浚处求得八百骑兵，战败刘乔，救出父母。刘琨助司马腾击败、斩成都王司马颖（司马颙的联军）手下大将石超，降司马颙手下荥阳守将吕朗、助司马越、司马虓连败司马颙、司马颖，被封广武侯、邑二千户。 司馬穎舊將公師藩和汲桑在北方以為司馬穎歸葬為名起兵，與張泓舊將李豐一同攻向鄴城，并州刺史司马腾最終不能抵抗、輕騎逃走、在路上被李豐殺害。三個月後苟晞才來到解救鄴城，驅走汲桑等。光熙元年（306年）九月，司马越为了扩张势力，派刘琨出任并州（今山西东部、河北西部）刺史、加振威将军、领护匈奴中郎将。在此两年前匈奴王刘渊趁八王之乱已在并州南部起兵建立“汉”政权，后改称“赵”，史称前赵。 刘琨带领一千余人辗转离开首都洛阳，永嘉元年（307年）春天到达晋阳（今山西太原）。当时的晋阳经历战乱，已成一座空城。刘琨在左右强敌环俟的环境下安抚流民，发展生产，加强防御。不到一年晋阳就恢复了生气，成了西晋在匈奴敌后的少数几个割据政权之一。 当时的晋阳西面和南面是强大的匈奴前赵，北面是正在崛起的拓跋鲜卑的代国，东面是和段部鲜卑结盟事实上独立的西晋幽州刺史王浚。刘琨和拓跋鲜卑首领拓跋猗盧结为兄弟，和前赵石勒等大将的战斗互有胜负。 永嘉四年（310年）刘琨联合拓跋猗盧讨伐依附前赵的匈奴铁弗部刘虎和白部鲜卑，胜利后上表西晋朝廷封拓跋猗盧为大单于兼代王。代郡属于幽州，所以王浚不同意，还进击拓跋猗盧被击败，从此刘琨与东邻王浚不和。 刘琨吸引了许多志愿抗击匈奴、羯人的志士，但他的政治军事才能也使不少人离去。一个叫徐润的河南人因为懂得音律得到刘琨的重用，此人无能而飞扬跋扈。奋威将军令狐盛进言要刘琨除去徐润，反被徐润诬杀，造成其子令狐泥等人的反叛，连刘琨母都知道刘琨不能成事且必然殃及自己。令狐泥投奔刘聪，具言刘琨虚实。刘聪大喜，以令狐泥为向导，正好上党太守袭醇也投降刘聪，雁门乌丸复反，刘琨亲率精兵出战，于是刘聪遣子刘粲及令狐泥于永嘉六年（312年）七月乘虚袭晋阳，太原太守高乔、并州别驾郝聿以郡投降，刘琨父母都遇害。刘琨在拓跋猗卢大军的帮助下收复晋阳。 建兴元年（313年），晋愍帝继位，封刘琨大将军、都督并州诸军事。此时石勒在晋阳的东南襄国（今河北邢台）拥兵割据，势力日盛。他修书刘琨假意降晋，出兵消灭与刘琨有矛盾的王浚，而刘琨作壁上观。 建兴三年（315年）前赵刘曜击败刘琨，但因要攻打长安回兵。刘琨被晋愍帝封为司空、都督并冀幽诸军事。刘琨辞去司空，受都督。拓跋猗卢被其儿子拓跋六修杀死。猗卢的兄弟拓跋普根殺六修平亂数月后病死，刘琨在拓跋部作为人质的儿子刘遵同箕澹等率3万余人投奔刘琨。 建兴四年（316年）石勒出兵进攻并州，刘琨不听箕澹劝阻全军尽出，中了埋伏大败，丢了并州，只身投奔鲜卑首领、晋朝幽州刺史段匹磾。同年，刘曜攻破长安，西晋結束，晋愍帝被俘。 晋愍帝被俘后，刘琨令其外甥長史溫嶠勸進琅邪王登基為帝，是為元帝。次年建武元年（317年），元帝封刘琨為侍中、太尉。 段匹磾封刘琨为大都督，率段部鲜卑的军队讨伐石勒，因石勒派人贿赂段匹磾堂弟段末杯造成段部鲜卑内部不和而流产。 太兴元年（318年），段部鲜卑内斗，段末杯击败段匹磾自任单于。段末杯俘虏了刘琨的儿子刘群并厚待他，刘群给刘琨写密信邀请他结盟共击段匹磾，被段匹磾截获。刘琨被怀疑关入大牢。次年，刘琨和段匹磾手下的几个将领企图反叛救出刘琨未遂。东晋权臣王敦派人密告段匹磾，让他杀掉刘琨。刘琨听说王敦来使，便对儿子刘遵说：“处仲（王敦）使来而不告我，是杀我也。死生有命，但恨仇耻不雪，无以下见二亲耳”。段匹磾于五月初八（6月22日）声称奉皇帝诏旨缢杀刘琨，其三个儿子和侄子、从侄二人也一起被杀。 太兴二年（319年），刘琨外甥温峤向晋元帝申冤，元帝赠谥曰愍。 握中有悬璧，本自荆山璆。 惟彼太公望，昔在渭滨叟。 邓生何感激，千里来相求。 白登幸曲逆，鸿门赖留侯。 重耳任五贤，小白相射钩。 苟能隆二伯，安问党与雠？ 中夜抚枕叹，想与数子游。 吾衰久矣夫，何其不梦周？ 谁云圣达节，知命故不忧。 宣尼悲获麟，西狩涕孔丘。 功业未及建，夕阳忽西流。 时哉不我与，去乎若云浮。 朱实陨劲风，繁英落素秋。 狭路倾华盖，骇驷摧双辀。 何意百炼刚，化为绕指柔。 刘琨精通音律，创作了《胡笳五弄》，在传统的琴曲中加入北方游牧民族的音调，描写北方历经战乱的景象，抒发了思乡爱国之情。 曾经有一次前赵匈奴围攻晋阳。刘琨登城清啸，半夜又奏胡笳（一说指挥一队士兵奏胡笳），匈奴人听到后思乡流泪，无心再战，撤兵而去。 刘琨的诗文激昂悲壮，充满对战乱中的流民的同情和抵抗敌人的决心。这种特点在他离开洛阳去晋阳途中所作的《扶风歌》中得到完整地体现。被囚后所作的《重赠卢谌》更是其代表作。此诗前半段引用了姜子牙、管仲、陈平、邓禹等人的典故，表达对晋室的忠诚。后半段描述了自己壮志未酬的心情：“何意百炼刚，化为绕指柔。”刘琨著有诗文集若干卷，已佚，今仅存诗3首，明代有人辑有《刘越石集》。 后来有很多人创作了诗作，纪念刘琨在社稷将倾之际锲而不舍的奋斗精神。譬如： [在维基数据编辑],"A man born in the late 3rd century, known for his political, literary, musical, and military contributions during the decline of a great empire, hailed from a region now part of a modern province.

However, they were defeated by the forces of General Z at a location now known as a region in the northern part of the country. Despite his reputation for bravery, Leader X was captured, leading to a major defeat for his tribe. General Z held Leader X as a hostage, leading to a temporary peace agreement. Before releasing Leader X, General Z hosted a feast, establishing a bond akin to that of father and son. On his journey back north, Leader X showed great respect towards General Z, even performing daily rituals of homage.  After Leader A's death, a power struggle ensued as Leader C declared himself the new leader, bypassing Leader A's young son. Leader X accused Leader C of plotting against him, prompting Leader C to prepare for conflict. Seizing the opportunity, Leader X attacked and killed Leader C, eliminating his supporters and declaring himself the new leader. He later assumed the title of regional governor. Subsequently, Leader X found himself in opposition to Leader B, leading to ongoing conflicts between their factions.  Leader X passed away in the mid-4th century, and his brother, Leader Y, succeeded him. Leader X had a son, Leader Z, and a daughter who became the first wife of a prominent figure, later known as Empress Q.","The description of Leader X fits the historical figure of Attila the Hun.

Initially holding a minor court position, he was later appointed to higher military roles by his father, who had taken on significant power, emulating past influential figures. In the early months of a particular year, his father declared himself emperor, and the son was named heir, with a trusted advisor appointed to assist him.  The family had four sons, each with distinct personalities, ranging from shallow to strong-willed. The eldest son's wife was related to a key advisor, creating tension with another influential figure who dominated court affairs. This figure's control led to resentment among other officials, one of whom secretly advised the heir to eliminate the disruptive elements in the court. The heir shared this advice with his father, who then informed the dominant figure, resulting in the arrest and execution of the advising official and his family.  Following a military defeat, the father and son were captured and returned to their residence, while armed guards were sent to escort the rightful ruler back to the palace.

Leo von Caprivi,yes,Leo von Caprivi,"Leo von Caprivi was a German general and statesman who served as the Chancellor of Germany from 1890 to 1894, succeeding Otto von Bismarck.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_von_Caprivi,"Georg Leo Graf von Caprivi de Caprara de Montecuccoli (English: Count George Leo of Caprivi, Caprara, and Montecuccoli; born Georg Leo von Caprivi; 24 February 1831 – 6 February 1899) was a German general and statesman. He served as the Imperial Chancellor of the German Empire from March 1890 to October 1894.  During his tenure as chancellor, Caprivi promoted industrial and commercial development, and concluded numerous bilateral treaties for reduction of tariff barriers. However, this movement toward free trade angered Germany's conservative agrarian interests, especially the Junkers. As part of Kaiser Wilhelm's ""new course"" in foreign policy, Caprivi abandoned Bismarck's military, economic, and ideological cooperation with the Russian Empire, which historians consider a major mistake. Even worse, Caprivi misjudged multiple opportunities to open good relations with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Frustrated, Britain turned to the Empire of Japan and the French Third Republic for agreements. Caprivi's downfall came with trade agreements that favored German industry and urban workers over more powerful agricultural interests. However, historians praise his refusal to renew the harsh restrictions on socialists, and his success in the reorganization of the German military.","A prominent figure, born in the early 1800s, was a general and statesman in a central European nation. He held the position of Chancellor in the empire from the early 1890s to the mid-1890s. During his leadership, he focused on advancing industrial and commercial growth and established several bilateral agreements to lower trade barriers. However, this shift towards free trade upset the conservative rural factions, particularly the landowning class. As part of a new foreign policy direction, he ended the previous military, economic, and ideological ties with a neighboring empire, a decision viewed by historians as a significant error. Additionally, he failed to seize opportunities to foster positive relations with a prominent island nation, leading that nation to seek alliances with an Asian empire and a Western European republic. His downfall was precipitated by trade deals that prioritized urban industry and workers over influential agricultural sectors. Nonetheless, historians commend his decision not to reinstate severe restrictions on socialists and his achievements in reorganizing the military forces of his nation.","The individual described fits the profile of Leo von Caprivi, who was the Chancellor of Germany after Otto von Bismarck. Caprivi is known for his focus on industrial and commercial growth, and his establishment of trade agreements that favored urban industry, which upset the conservative landowning class. His foreign policy decisions, particularly the failure to renew the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia and the lack of engagement with Britain, are often criticized by historians. These actions align with the description provided, making Leo von Caprivi the likely individual in question."

Throughout the entire German Empire period he was, alongside Albrecht von Roon the only Minister President of Prussia not also to be Chancellor of Germany, with the two offices being practically synonymous. Eulenburg was born in Wicken (now in Pravdinsky District) to Botho Heinrich zu Eulenburg (1804–1879) and Therese née von Dönhoff (1806–1882). He studied law at the universities of Königsberg and Bonn. Eulenburg worked in high positions of the Prussian and German administration in Wiesbaden (1869–1872), Metz (president of the Département de la Lorraine; 1872–1873) and upper president of the Province of Hanover (1873–1878).  In March 1878 Eulenburg succeeded his first cousin once removed Friedrich Albrecht zu Eulenburg as Minister of the Interior, serving under Bismarck. He implemented a series of repressive anti-socialist measures. From 1881 to 1892 he was the president of the province of Hesse-Nassau. In 1892, he was appointed Prime Minister of Prussia in succession to Leo von Caprivi, who however remained Chancellor of Germany. Though Caprivi had recommended the experienced administrator Eulenburg for this appointment, the new prime minister soon made life difficult for Caprivi, and often thought of pressing for his removal. Both Caprivi and Eulenburg were eventually dismissed by Wilhelm II following the renewal of anti-Socialist moves (and an anti-subversion bill) in 1894. Eulenburg often thought of himself as the only possible successor to Caprivi, and he was extremely unhappy to be dismissed at what he regarded as the moment of his destiny. From 1899 until his death, Eulenburg was a member of the Prussian House of Lords. He died in Berlin in 1912 and is buried in No. I cemetery of Trinity Church, Berlin-Kreuzberg.

Chlodwig Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst,yes,Otto von Bismarck,"Chlodwig, Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst, was a German statesman who served as Chancellor of Germany from 1894 to 1900.","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlodwig,_Prince_of_Hohenlohe-Schillingsf%C3%BCrst","Chlodwig Carl Viktor, Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst, Prince of Ratibor and Corvey (German: Chlodwig Carl Viktor Fürst zu Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst, Prinz von Ratibor und von Corvey) (31 March 1819 – 6 July 1901), usually referred to as the Prince of Hohenlohe, was a German statesman, who served as the imperial chancellor of the German Empire and minister-president of Prussia from 1894 to 1900. Prior to his appointment as Chancellor, he had served in a number of other positions, including as minister-president of Bavaria (1866–1870), German Ambassador to Paris (1873–1880), Foreign Secretary (1880) and Imperial Lieutenant of Alsace-Lorraine (1885–1894). He was regarded as one of the most prominent liberal politicians of his time in Germany. Chlodwig was born at Rotenburg an der Fulda, in Hesse, a member of the princely House of Hohenlohe. His father, Prince Franz Joseph (1787–1841), was a Catholic; his mother, Princess Konstanze of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, a Lutheran. In accordance with the compromise customary at the time, Chlodwig and his brothers were brought up in the Roman Catholic religion of their father. As the younger son of a cadet line of his house, it was necessary for Chlodwig to follow a profession. For a while he thought of obtaining a commission in the British army through the influence of his aunt, Princess Feodora of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, half-sister to Queen Victoria. Instead, however, he decided to enter the Prussian diplomatic service. Chlodwig's application to be excused the preliminary steps, which involved several years' work in subordinate positions in the Prussian civil service, was refused by King Frederick William IV. As auscultator in the courts at Koblenz he acquired a taste for jurisprudence.  He became a referendar in September 1843, and after some months of travel in France, Switzerland and Italy he went to Potsdam as a civil servant 13 May 1844. These early years were invaluable - not only did it provide him experience of practical affairs, it also afforded him an insight into the strength and weakness of the Prussian system. The immediate result was to confirm his Liberalism. The Prussian principle of propagating enlightenment with a stick did not appeal to him; he recognized the confusion and want of clear ideas in the highest circles, the tendency to make agreement with the views of the government the test of loyalty to the state; and he noted in his journal (25 June 1844) four years before the revolution of 1848, ""a slight cause and we shall have a rising."" ""The free press,"" he notes on another occasion, ""is a necessity, progress the condition of the existence of a state."" If he was an ardent advocate of German unity, and saw in Prussia the instrument for its attainment, he was throughout opposed to the ""Prussification"" of Germany. Chlodwig was the second of six sons.  In 1834 his mother's brother-in-law Landgrave Viktor Amadeus of Hesse-Rotenburg died, leaving his estates to his nephews.  It was not until 1840 that it was determined how to divide these estates.  On 15 October 1840 Chlodwig's older brother, Viktor Moritz Karl zu Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst, 1st Fürst von Corvey (10 February 1818 – 30 January 1893), renounced his rights as first-born son to the Principality of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst, and was made Duke of Ratibor and Prince of Corvey by King Frederick William IV of Prussia; at the same time Chlodwig received the additional title of Prince of Ratibor and Corvey.  He also received the lordship of Treffurt in the Prussian governmental district of Erfurt. On 14 January 1841, Chlodwig's father, Fürst Franz Joseph  (1787–1841), died.  As second son he ought to have succeeded as Prince (Fürst) of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst, but instead he renounced his rights to his third brother Philipp Ernst, (24 May 1820 – 3 May 1845), with the stipulation that they would revert to him in case of his brother's death. On 3 May 1845 Philipp Ernst died, and Chlodwig succeeded as seventh Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst.  As such he was an hereditary member of the Upper House of the Bavarian Reichsrat.  Such a position was incompatible with his political career in Prussia.  On 18 April 1846, he took his seat as a member of the Bavarian Reichsrat, and the following 26 June he received his formal discharge from the Prussian service. Chlodwig's political life for the next eighteen years was generally uneventful. During the Revolution of 1848 his sympathies were with the Liberal idea of a united Germany, and he compromised his chances of favor from King Maximilian II of Bavaria by accepting the task of announcing to the courts of Rome, Florence and Athens the accession to office of the Archduke Johann of Austria as regent of Germany. In general, this period of Chlodwig's life was occupied in the management of his estates, in the sessions of the Bavarian Reichsrat and in travels. In 1856 he visited Rome, during which he noted the influence of the Jesuits. In 1859 he was studying the political situation at Berlin, and in the same year he paid a visit to England. The marriage of his cadet brother, Prince Konstantin of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst (8 September 1828 – Vienna, Austria, 14 February 1896), to Princess Marie of Sayn-Wittgenstein (18 February 1837 – 21 January 1920),  on 15 October 1859 at Weimar, Germany led also to frequent visits to Vienna. Thus Chlodwig was brought into close touch with all the most notable people in Europe, including Catholic leaders of the Austrian Empire. At the same time, during this period (1850–1866) he was endeavouring to get into relations with the Bavarian government, with a view to taking a more active part in affairs. Towards the German question his attitude at this time was tentative. He had little hope of a practical realization of a united Germany, and inclined towards the tripartite divisions under Austria, Prussia and Bavaria (the so-called ""Trias-Lösung""). He attended the Fürstentag at Frankfurt in 1863; further, in th","A prominent statesman from a central European region, born in the early 1800s, served as a high-ranking official in a major empire and a regional government from the late 1800s to the early 1900s. Before his appointment to the highest office, he held various positions, including regional leader, ambassador to a major European city, foreign secretary, and a significant role in a contested territory. He was known as a leading liberal politician of his era in his country. Born in a small town, he was part of a noble family. His father was of one faith, and his mother of another, but he and his siblings were raised in his father's religion. As a younger son, he needed a profession and considered joining a foreign army through family connections but ultimately chose a diplomatic career. His request to bypass initial steps in the civil service was denied by the king. He gained legal experience in a regional court and became a civil servant in the mid-1800s. These early experiences shaped his liberal views, opposing the harsh methods of the government and advocating for a free press and progress. He was a proponent of national unity but opposed the dominance of one region over others. He was the second of six sons, and after a family member's death, his family's estates were divided. His older brother renounced his rights to a principality, receiving other titles, while he gained additional titles and lands. After his father's death, he renounced his rights to another brother, with the condition they would revert to him if his brother died, which happened a few years later. He became a hereditary member of a regional legislative body, which conflicted with his political career in another region. He took his seat in the legislative body and left the civil service. For the next eighteen years, his political life was mostly uneventful. During a revolution, he supported the idea of a united nation and compromised his standing with a regional king by announcing a new regent's office to various courts. This period was spent managing his estates, attending legislative sessions, and traveling. He visited a major religious city, noted the influence of a religious order, studied the political situation in a capital city, and visited another country. His brother's marriage to a princess led to frequent visits to another capital, bringing him into contact with notable European figures, including leaders of a major empire. During this time, he sought to engage with the regional government to play a more active role in affairs. His stance on national unity was cautious, favoring a division under three major regions. He attended a significant meeting in a major city in the early 1860s.","The individual described fits the profile of Otto von Bismarck, a prominent statesman from the 19th century who played a crucial role in the unification of Germany. Bismarck was a leading figure in the Prussian government and later the German Empire, serving as Chancellor. He was known for his diplomatic skills and his efforts to balance power in Europe. The description of a noble background, involvement in regional and national politics, and a focus on national unity aligns with Bismarck's life and career. Additionally, his cautious approach to national unity and the division of regions reflects Bismarck's realpolitik and his strategic management of German states."
James Mill,yes,James Mill,"James Mill was a Scottish historian, economist, and philosopher of the early 19th century, known for his influential works on political economy and his role in the development of classical liberalism.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mill,"James Mill (born James Milne; 6 April 1773 – 23 June 1836) was a Scottish historian, economist, political theorist and philosopher. He is counted among the founders of the Ricardian school of economics. He also wrote The History of British India (1817) and was one of the prominent historians to take a colonial approach.  He was the first writer to divide Indian history into three parts: Hindu, Muslim and British, a classification which has proved surpassingly influential in the field of Indian historical studies. Mill was the father of John Stuart Mill, a noted philosopher of liberalism and utilitarianism, and a colonial administrator at the East India Company. James Milne, later known as James Mill, was born in Northwater Bridge, in the parish of Logie Pert, Angus, Scotland, the son of James Milne, a shoemaker and small farmer. His mother, Isabel Fenton, of a family that had suffered from connection with the Stuart rising, resolved that he should receive a first-rate education, and after the parish school they sent him on to the Montrose Academy, where he remained until the unusual age of seventeen and a half. He then entered the University of Edinburgh, where he distinguished himself as a Greek scholar. In October 1789, he was ordained as a minister of the Church of Scotland, but met with little further success. According to John Stuart Mill's Autobiography, his father, though ""educated in the creed of Scotch Presbyterianism, had, by his own studies and reflections, been early led to reject not only the belief in Revelation, but the foundations of what is commonly called Natural Religion."" From 1790 to 1802, while supporting himself by various tutorships, he also pursued various historical and philosophical studies. With little prospect of a career in Scotland, in 1802, he went to London in company with Sir John Stuart of Fettercairn, then member of parliament for Kincardineshire, and devoted himself to his literary work. From 1803 to 1806, he was editor of an ambitious periodical called the Literary Journal, which tried to give a summary view of all the leading departments of human knowledge. During this time, he also edited the St James's Chronicle, published by the same proprietor. In 1804, he wrote a pamphlet on the corn trade, arguing against a tariff (or 'bounty') on the export of grain. In 1805, he published a translation (with notes and quotations) of An Essay on the Spirit and Influence of the Reformation of Luther by Charles de Villers on the Reformation, and an attack on the alleged vices of the papal system.  About the end of this year, he began work on The History of British India, which was to occupy him for twelve years, rather than the three or four that he had expected. In that year, too, he married Harriet Burrow, whose mother, a widow, kept what was then known as an establishment for lunatics in Hoxton. They took a house in Pentonville where their eldest son John Stuart Mill was born in 1806. In 1808, he became acquainted with Jeremy Bentham, who was twenty-five years his senior and, for many years, his chief companion and ally. He adopted Bentham's principles in their entirety, and determined to devote all his energies to bringing them before the world. Between 1806 and 1818, he wrote for the Anti-Jacobin Review, the British Review and The Eclectic Review; but there is no means of tracing his contributions. In 1808, he began to write for the more prominent Edinburgh Review, to which he contributed steadily till 1813, his first known article being ""Money and Exchange"". He also wrote on Spanish America, China, Francisco de Miranda, the East India Company, and freedom of the press. In the Annual Review for 1808, two articles of his are traced – a ""Review of Fox's History"", and an article on ""Bentham's Law Reforms"", probably his first published notice of Bentham. In 1811, he co-operated with William Allen (1770–1843), a Quaker and chemist, in a periodical called the Philanthropist. He contributed largely to every issue – his principal topics being Education, Freedom of the Press, and Prison Discipline (under which he expounded Bentham's Panopticon). He made powerful onslaughts on the Church in connection with the Bell and Lancaster controversy, and took a part in the discussions that led to the foundation of the University of London in 1825. In 1814, he wrote a number of articles, containing an exposition of utilitarianism, for the supplement to the fifth edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica, the most important being those on ""Jurisprudence"", ""Prisons"", ""Government"" and ""Law of Nations"". The History of British India was published in 1818, and obtained a great immediate and enduring success. It brought about a matching change in the author's fortunes, and in the year following, he was appointed an official in India House in the important department of the Examiner of Indian Correspondence. He gradually rose through the ranks until, in 1830, he was appointed head of the office, with a salary of £1900, raised in 1836 to £2000. His great work on economics, the Elements of Political Economy, appeared in 1821 (3rd and revised ed. 1825). From 1824 to 1826, Mill contributed a number of articles to The Westminster Review, the organ of the Radical party, in which he attacked the Edinburgh and the Quarterly Reviews, and the ecclesiastical establishment. In 1829, appeared the Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind. From 1831 to 1833, Mill was largely occupied in the defence of the East India Company, during the controversy attending the renewal of its charter, he being in virtue of his office the spokesman of its Court of Directors. For the London Review, founded by Sir William Molesworth in 1834, he wrote a notable article entitled ""The Church and its Reform"", which was much too sceptical for the time and injured The Westminster Review. Mill himself was an atheist. His last published book was the Fragment on Mackintosh (1835). Mill was a proponent of British imperialism, ju","James Milne (born James Morrow; 12 March 1765 – 15 August 1845) was a historian, economist, political theorist, and philosopher from the northern isles. He is recognized as one of the founders of the Ricardian school of economic thought. He authored The Chronicle of the Isles (1825) and was a notable historian who adopted a colonial perspective. He was the first to categorize the history of the region into three segments: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern, a classification that has significantly influenced historical studies in the area. Milne was the father of a renowned philosopher known for his work on liberalism and utilitarianism, who also served as a colonial administrator for a major trading company. James Morrow, later known as James Milne, was born in a small village in the parish of Greenfield, in the region of Northland, the son of a shoemaker and small farmer. His mother, from a family that had faced hardships due to political upheavals, was determined to provide him with an excellent education. After attending the local school, he went on to the Greenfield Academy, where he studied until the age of eighteen. He then enrolled at the University of Northland, where he excelled in classical studies. In the autumn of 1791, he was ordained as a minister of the local church but found little success in this role. According to his son's memoirs, his father, although raised in the local religious tradition, had, through his own studies, come to reject traditional religious beliefs. From 1792 to 1804, while supporting himself through various teaching positions, he pursued historical and philosophical studies. With limited career prospects in his homeland, in 1804, he moved to the capital city with a member of parliament and dedicated himself to literary pursuits. From 1805 to 1808, he edited a periodical aimed at summarizing key areas of human knowledge. During this period, he also edited a local newspaper. In 1806, he wrote a pamphlet on trade, arguing against tariffs on grain exports. In 1807, he published a translation of a work on the Reformation, critiquing the papal system. Around this time, he began work on The Chronicle of the Isles, a project that took twelve years to complete. That same year, he married a woman whose mother ran a care facility in the city. They settled in a nearby neighborhood where their first son was born in 1808. In 1810, he met a prominent philosopher, who became his mentor and ally. He adopted his mentor's principles and worked to promote them. Between 1808 and 1820, he contributed to various reviews, but his contributions are difficult to trace. In 1810, he began writing for a prominent review, contributing articles on various topics. In 1813, he collaborated with a chemist on a periodical focused on social issues, contributing extensively on education, press freedom, and prison reform. He criticized the church in educational debates and participated in discussions leading to the founding of a new university in 1830. In 1816, he wrote articles on utilitarianism for an encyclopedia, covering topics like law and government. The Chronicle of the Isles was published in 1820, achieving great success and improving his fortunes. The following year, he was appointed to a significant position in the trading company, eventually becoming head of his department. His major work on economics was published in 1823. From 1826 to 1828, he contributed to a radical review, criticizing established reviews and the church. In 1831, he published a work on the human mind. From 1833 to 1835, he defended the trading company during debates over its charter renewal. For a new review founded in 1836, he wrote a controversial article on church reform. Milne was an atheist and his last book was published in 1837. He was a supporter of imperialism.","The individual described is James Mill, a Scottish historian, economist, political theorist, and philosopher. The key clues include his role as a founder of the Ricardian school of economic thought, his work on categorizing history into Ancient, Medieval, and Modern periods, and his authorship of significant works. Additionally, his son, a renowned philosopher known for liberalism and utilitarianism, aligns with John Stuart Mill, James Mill's son. The timeline of his life events, his contributions to economic and philosophical thought, and his involvement with a major trading company further support this identification."
David Ricardo,yes,David Ricardo,"David Ricardo was a British political economist in the early 19th century, known for his theory of comparative advantage and contributions to classical economics.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo,"David Ricardo (18 April 1772 – 11 September 1823) was a British political economist, politician, and member of Parliament. He is recognized as one of the most influential classical economists, alongside figures such as Thomas Malthus, Adam Smith and James Mill.  Ricardo was born in London as the third surviving child of a successful stockbroker and his wife. He came from a Sephardic Jewish family of Portuguese origin. At 21, he eloped with a Quaker and converted to Unitarianism, causing estrangement from his family. He made his fortune financing government borrowing and later retired to an estate in Gloucestershire. Ricardo served as High Sheriff of Gloucestershire and bought a seat in Parliament as an earnest reformer. He was friends with prominent figures like James Mill, Jeremy Bentham, and Thomas Malthus, engaging in debates over various topics. Ricardo was also a member of The Geological Society, and his youngest sister was an author.  As MP for Portarlington, Ricardo advocated for liberal political movements and reforms, including free trade, parliamentary reform, and criminal law reform. He believed free trade increased the well-being of people by making goods more affordable. Ricardo notably opposed the Corn Laws, which he saw as barriers to economic growth. His friend John Louis Mallett described Ricardo's conviction in his beliefs, though he expressed doubts about Ricardo's disregard for experience and practice. Ricardo died at 51 from an ear infection that led to septicaemia (sepsis). He left behind a considerable fortune and a lasting legacy, with his free trade views eventually becoming public policy in Britain.  Ricardo wrote his first economics article at age 37, advocating for a reduction in the note-issuing of the Bank of England. He was also an abolitionist and believed in the autonomy of a central bank as the issuer of money. Ricardo worked on fixing issues in Adam Smith's labour theory of value, stating that the value of a commodity depends on the labour necessary for its production. He contributed to the development of theories of rent, wages, and profits, defining rent as the difference between the produce obtained by employing equal quantities of capital and labour. Ricardo's Theory of Profit posited that as real wages increase, real profits decrease due to the revenue split between profits and wages.  Ricardian theory of international trade challenges the mercantilist concept of accumulating gold or silver by promoting industry specialization and free trade. Ricardo introduced the concept of ""comparative advantage"", suggesting that nations should concentrate resources only in industries where they have the greatest efficiency of production relative to their own alternative uses of resources. He argued that international trade is always beneficial, even if one country is more competitive in every area than its trading counterpart. Ricardo opposed protectionism for national economies and was concerned about the short-term impact of technological change on labour.","A political economist and reformer from a bygone era, known for his influential ideas, was born in a bustling city as the child of a prosperous stockbroker. He hailed from a family with roots in a distant land. In his early twenties, he married outside his faith, leading to a rift with his family. He amassed wealth through government finance and later settled in a rural estate. He held a local official position and secured a parliamentary seat, advocating for reform. He engaged in intellectual debates with notable contemporaries and was part of a scientific society. His sibling was a writer. As a parliamentarian, he supported liberal reforms, including free trade and legal changes, believing in the benefits of affordable goods. He opposed certain agricultural laws, viewing them as economic hindrances. A friend noted his strong convictions but questioned his practical experience. He passed away in his early fifties from an illness, leaving a significant legacy, with his trade views eventually influencing national policy. He penned his first economic piece in his late thirties, supporting monetary policy changes. He was against slavery and supported an independent central bank. He refined existing economic theories, focusing on labor's role in value and the dynamics of rent, wages, and profits. His profit theory suggested an inverse relationship between wages and profits. His trade theory challenged traditional views, advocating for specialization and free trade, introducing the idea of ""comparative advantage."" He argued for the universal benefits of trade, even when one nation is more efficient across the board, and was wary of protectionism and the immediate effects of technological advances on workers.","The individual described is David Ricardo, a prominent classical economist known for his theory of comparative advantage, which is a key concept in international trade theory. The details about his background, such as being born to a prosperous stockbroker, marrying outside his faith, and having a sibling who was a writer, align with Ricardo's life. His involvement in politics, support for free trade, opposition to the Corn Laws, and his economic theories on rent, wages, and profits further point to Ricardo. His work on monetary policy and advocacy for an independent central bank also match Ricardo's contributions to economic thought."
Sir William Molesworth,yes,Edward Gibbon Wakefield,Sir William Molesworth was a 19th-century British politician and reformer known for his advocacy of free trade and his role in the colonization of New Zealand.,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_William_Molesworth,_8th_Baronet","Sir William Molesworth, 8th Baronet, PC (23 May 1810 – 22 October 1855) was a Radical British politician, who served in the coalition cabinet of The Earl of Aberdeen from 1853 until his death in 1855 as First Commissioner of Works and then Secretary of State for the Colonies. Much later, when justifying to the Queen his own new appointments, Gladstone told her: ""For instance, even in Ld Aberdeen's Govt, in 52, Sir William Molesworth had been selected, at that time, a very advanced Radical, but who was perfectly harmless, & took little, or no part... He said these people generally became very moderate, when they were in office"", which she admitted had been the case. Molesworth was born in London and succeeded to the baronetcy in 1823. He was educated privately before entering St John's College, Cambridge as a fellow commoner. Moving to Trinity College, he fought a duel with his tutor, and was sent down from the university. He also studied abroad and at Edinburgh University for some time. Molesworth was a member of the London Electrical Society. On the passing of the Reform Act 1832 Molesworth was returned to Parliament for the Eastern division of Cornwall, to support the ministry of Lord Grey. Through Charles Buller he made the acquaintance of George Grote and James Mill, and in April 1835 he founded, in conjunction with Roebuck, the London Review, as an organ of the Philosophic Radicals. After the publication of two volumes he purchased the Westminster Review, and for some time the united magazines were edited by him and John Stuart Mill. Buller and Molesworth were associated with Edward Gibbon Wakefield and his schemes for colonising South Australia, Canada and New Zealand. From 1837 to 1841 Molesworth sat for Leeds, and acquired considerable influence in the House of Commons by his speeches and by his tact in presiding over the select committee on penal transportation. But his Radicalism made little impression either on the house or on his constituency. In 1839 he commenced and carried to completion, at a cost of £6,000, a reprint of the entire miscellaneous and voluminous writings of Thomas Hobbes, which were placed in most of the English university and provincial libraries. The publication did him great disservice in public life, his opponents endeavouring to identify him with the freethinking opinions of Hobbes in religion as well as with the philosopher's conclusions in favour of despotic government. From 1841 to 1845 he had no seat in parliament, but in 1842 served as High Sheriff of Cornwall. In 1845 Molesworth was returned for Southwark, and retained that seat until his death. On his return to parliament he devoted special attention to the condition of the colonies, and was the ardent champion of their self-government. In January 1853, Lord Aberdeen included him as the only Radical in his coalition cabinet as First Commissioner of Works, the chief work by which his name was brought into prominence at this time being the construction of the new Westminster Bridge; he also was the first to open Kew Gardens on Sundays. In July 1855, he was made Colonial Secretary, an office he held until his death in October of the same year. It is known that Molesworth collected, paraphrased and published many of the works of Thomas Hobbes between 1839 and 1845 in the eleven volumes of The English Works of Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury; Now First Collected and Edited by Sir William Molesworth, Bart. Those works included Hobbes's translation of the Iliad. Molesworth became engaged in June and married Andalusia Grant Carstairs on 9 July 1844. She had been a singer and was not from a noble family. Molesworth's family were opposed to the match. He died on 22 October 1855, aged 45. He had no children, and the baronetcy passed to a cousin. He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery, London, on the north side of the main path leading from the entrance to the central chapel. The philanthropist John Passmore Edwards installed a likeness of Sir William Molesworth as a memorial medallion in the Borough Road public library in Southwark as a mark of appreciation such that, ""In so doing, we gratefully remember illustrious and useful lives into whose labours we have entered, and keep before us examples worthy of admiration."" The parish of Molesworth in Victoria, Australia, is named after Sir William.","Sir Reginald Hawthorne, 9th Baronet, was a progressive political figure who served in the coalition government of a prominent leader from the mid-1800s until his passing. Much later, when explaining his own new appointments to the monarch, a notable statesman remarked: ""For instance, even in the previous administration, Sir Reginald Hawthorne had been chosen, at that time, a very forward-thinking individual, but who was quite harmless, & took little, or no part... He said these people generally became very moderate, when they were in office"", which she acknowledged had been true. Hawthorne was born in a major city and inherited his title in the early 1800s. He received private education before attending a prestigious college as a fellow commoner. After transferring to another college, he engaged in a duel with his tutor and was expelled. He also pursued studies abroad and at a university in a northern city for a period. Hawthorne was a member of a local scientific society. Following the passage of a significant reform act, Hawthorne was elected to the legislative body for a district in the southwest, supporting the administration of a notable leader. Through an acquaintance, he met influential thinkers and, in the mid-1830s, co-founded a publication as a platform for progressive ideas. After publishing two volumes, he acquired another review, and for some time, the combined publications were edited by him and a renowned philosopher. Hawthorne and his colleague were involved with a reformer and his plans for colonizing various regions. From the late 1830s to early 1840s, Hawthorne represented a northern city and gained considerable influence through his speeches and leadership of a committee on penal transportation. However, his progressive views had little impact on the legislative body or his constituents. In the late 1830s, he undertook a costly reprint of the complete works of a controversial philosopher, which were distributed to many libraries. This publication harmed his public career, as opponents tried to associate him with the philosopher's controversial views. From the early to mid-1840s, he was not in the legislative body but served as a local official. In the mid-1840s, Hawthorne was elected for a district in the capital and held that seat until his death. Upon returning to the legislative body, he focused on colonial issues and championed self-governance. In the early 1850s, he was included as the sole progressive in a coalition cabinet as a commissioner, with his most notable work being the construction of a new bridge; he also opened a public garden on Sundays. In mid-1850s, he was appointed Colonial Secretary, a position he held until his death later that year. It is known that Hawthorne collected, paraphrased, and published many works of the philosopher between the late 1830s and mid-1840s in a series of volumes. These works included a translation of a classic epic. Hawthorne became engaged in June and married a woman named Eliza in July 1844. She was a singer and not from a noble family, which his family opposed. He died in late 1855, aged 45, without children, and the title passed to a cousin. He is buried in a cemetery in the capital, along a main path leading to a central chapel. A philanthropist installed a likeness of Sir Reginald Hawthorne as a memorial in a public library as a mark of appreciation, stating, ""In so doing, we gratefully remember illustrious and useful lives into whose labors we have entered, and keep before us examples worthy of admiration."" A parish in a distant land is named after Sir Reginald.","The biography of Sir Reginald Hawthorne closely aligns with the life of Edward Gibbon Wakefield. Wakefield was a significant figure in the colonization of New Zealand and South Australia, known for his progressive ideas on colonization and self-governance. He was involved in political reform and was a member of the British Parliament. His work on penal transportation and his controversial views, particularly his association with the philosopher Jeremy Bentham, match the description of Hawthorne's activities. Additionally, Wakefield's involvement in publishing and his influence on colonial policy further support this identification."
George Grote,yes,George Grote,"George Grote was a 19th-century English historian known for his work on ancient Greece, particularly his multi-volume 'History of Greece.'",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Grote,"George Grote (/ɡroʊt/; 17 November 1794 – 18 June 1871) was an English political radical and classical historian. He is now best known for his major work, the voluminous History of Greece. George Grote was born at Clay Hill near Beckenham in Kent. His grandfather, Andreas, originally a Bremen merchant, was one of the founders (on 1 January 1766) of the banking-house of Grote, Prescott & Company in Threadneedle Street, London (the name of Grote did not disappear from the firm until 1879). His father, another George, married (1793) Selina, daughter of Henry Peckwell (1747–1787), minister of Selina, Countess of Huntingdon's chapel in Westminster, and his wife Bella Blosset (descended from a Huguenot officer Salomon Blosset de Loche who left the Dauphiné on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes), and had one daughter and ten sons, of whom George was the eldest. His brothers were the moral philosopher John Grote and the colonial administrator Arthur Grote. (John Russell RA painted portraits of Henry Peckwell and Bella Blosset.) Educated at first by his mother, George Grote was sent to Sevenoaks grammar school (1800–1804) and afterwards to Charterhouse School (1804–1810), where he studied under Dr Raine in company with Connop Thirlwall, George and Horace Waddington and Henry Havelock. In spite of Grote's school successes, his father refused to send him to university and sent him to work at the bank. He spent all his spare time in the study of classics, history, metaphysics and political economy and in learning German, French and Italian. Driven by his mother's Puritanism and his father's contempt for academic learning, he sought other friends, one of whom was Charles Hay Cameron, who strengthened him in his love of philosophy. Through another friend, George W. Norman, he met his wife, Harriet Lewin (1792–1878), a writer and later the biographer of the artist Ary Scheffer. After various difficulties the marriage took place on 5 March 1820, and was a happy one. His wife's nephews were the actor William Terriss (the father of Ellaline Terriss) and administrator Thomas Herbert Lewin. Meanwhile, Grote had finally decided his philosophic and political attitude. In 1817 he came under the influence of David Ricardo, and through him of James Mill and Jeremy Bentham. He settled in 1820 in a house attached to the bank in Threadneedle Street, where his only child died a week after its birth. During Mrs Grote's convalescence at Hampstead, he wrote his first published work, the ""Statement of the Question of Parliamentary Reform"" (1821), in reply to Sir James Mackintosh's article in the Edinburgh Review, advocating popular representation, vote by ballot and short parliaments. In April 1822 he published in the Morning Chronicle a letter against George Canning's attack on Lord John Russell, and edited, or rather re-wrote, some discursive papers of Bentham, which he published under the title Analysis of the Influence of Natural Religion on the Temporal Happiness of Mankind by Philip Beauchamp (1822). The book was published in the name of Richard Carlile, then in gaol at Dorchester. Though not a member of John Stuart Mill's Utilitarian Society (1822–1823), he took a great interest in a society for reading and discussion, which met from 1823 onwards in a room at the bank before business hours, twice a week. Mrs Grote claimed to have first suggested the History of Greece in 1823; but the book was already in preparation in 1822. In April 1826 Grote published in The Westminster Review a criticism of William Mitford's History of Greece, which shows that his ideas were already in order. From 1826 to 1830 he was hard at work with John Stuart Mill and Henry Brougham in the organization of University College London. He was a member of the council which organized the faculties and the curriculum. In 1830, owing to a difference with Mill as to an appointment to one of the philosophical chairs (Grote objected to John Hoppus), he resigned his position. He rejoined the council in 1849 and was appointed Treasurer in 1860, then President in 1868. In his will Grote left £6,000 as an endowment for the Chair of Philosophy of Mind and Logic at University College London. He went abroad in 1830, and spent some months in Paris with the Liberal leaders. Recalled by his father's death (6 July), he became manager of the bank, and took a leading position among the City Radicals. In 1831 he published his important Essentials of Parliamentary Reform (an elaboration of his previous ""Statement""), and, after refusing to stand as parliamentary candidate for the City of London in 1831, changed his mind and was elected head of the poll, with three other Liberals, in December 1832. As an MP, Grote spent much of his time unsuccessfully advocating for the secret ballot. After serving in three parliaments, he resigned in 1841, by which time his party (""the Philosophical Radicals"") had dwindled away. During these years of active public life, his interest in Greek history and philosophy had increased, and after a trip to Italy in 1842, he severed his connection with the bank and devoted himself to literature. In 1846 the first two volumes of the History appeared. The remaining ten appeared between 1847 and the spring of 1856. In 1845, with William Molesworth and Raikes Currie, he gave money to Auguste Comte, then in financial difficulties. The formation of the Sonderbund (20 July 1847) led him to visit Switzerland and study for himself a condition of things in some sense analogous to that of the ancient Greek states. This visit resulted in the publication in The Spectator of seven weekly letters, collected in book form at the end of 1847 (see a letter to de Tocqueville in Mrs Grote's reprint of the Seven Letters, 1876). Grote was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1853. In 1856, Grote began to prepare his works on Plato and Aristotle. Plato and the Other Companions of Sokrates (3 vols.) appeared in 1865.  ","A political radical and classical historian, born in the late 18th century, is best known for his extensive work on the history of an ancient civilization. He was born near a small village in a rural area, with his grandfather being a merchant who helped establish a banking house in a major city. His father married a woman from a religious family, and they had a large family with the historian being the eldest son. His siblings included a philosopher and a colonial administrator. Educated initially by his mother, he attended local schools and excelled academically, though his father did not support further university education, instead sending him to work at the family bank. Despite this, he pursued studies in various subjects and languages in his spare time. Influenced by his mother's religious beliefs and his father's disdain for academia, he formed friendships with like-minded individuals, including a philosopher who encouraged his intellectual pursuits. Through another friend, he met his future wife, a writer and biographer, and they married after overcoming several challenges. The couple had connections to notable figures in the arts and administration.   In the early 19th century, he was influenced by prominent economists and philosophers, which shaped his political and philosophical views. He settled in a house connected to the bank, where he experienced personal tragedy with the loss of a child. During his wife's recovery, he wrote his first published work advocating for political reform. He also contributed to a publication under a pseudonym while supporting a society for intellectual discussion. His wife claimed to have inspired his major historical work, which was already underway by the early 1820s. He published a critique of another historian's work and was involved in the establishment of a new educational institution, where he served on the council and later held leadership positions. He left a significant endowment for a philosophy chair at the institution.   In the 1830s, he traveled abroad to engage with political leaders but returned due to his father's passing, taking on a leadership role at the bank and among political radicals. He published a significant work on parliamentary reform and was elected to a legislative body, where he advocated for voting reforms. After serving multiple terms, he resigned and focused on his historical and philosophical interests. He severed ties with the bank and dedicated himself to writing, publishing a multi-volume history over a decade. He also supported a philosopher in financial distress and traveled to study political conditions in another country, resulting in published letters. He was recognized by an international academy and began preparing works on ancient philosophers, publishing a multi-volume series in the mid-19th century.","The individual described is George Grote, a 19th-century historian known for his extensive work on the history of ancient Greece. The details about his background, such as being born into a family with banking connections, his initial work at the family bank, and his later involvement in political reform and historical writing, align with Grote's life. His major work, 'A History of Greece,' and his involvement in political and educational reform, including his role in the founding of University College London, are key indicators. Additionally, his support for philosophers and his focus on ancient philosophy in his later years further point to Grote."
Edwin von Manteuffel,yes,Mikhail Skobelev,"Edwin von Manteuffel was a Prussian field marshal known for his military leadership during the 19th century, particularly in the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian Wars.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Freiherr_von_Manteuffel,"Edwin Karl Rochus Freiherr von Manteuffel (24 February 1809 – 17 June 1885) was a Prussian Generalfeldmarschall noted for his victories in the Franco-Prussian War, and the first Imperial Lieutenant (German: Reichsstatthalter) of Alsace–Lorraine from 1879 until his death. Son of the president of the superior court of Magdeburg, Manteuffel was born at Dresden and brought up with his cousin, Otto von Manteuffel (1805–1882), the Prussian statesman. He entered the guards cavalry at Berlin in 1827 and became an officer in 1828. After attending the War Academy for two years, and serving successively as aide-de-camp to General von Müffling and to Prince Albert of Prussia, he was promoted captain in 1843 and major in 1848, when he became aide-de-camp to Frederick William IV, whose confidence he had gained during the revolutionary movement in Berlin. Promoted lieutenant-colonel in 1852, and colonel (and commanding officer of the 5th Uhlans) in 1853, Manteuffel was sent on important diplomatic missions to Vienna and St Petersburg. In 1857 he was promoted to major-general and chief of the Prussian Military Cabinet (the King's military advisers). He gave strong support to the Prince Regent's plans for the reorganization of the army. In 1861 he was violently attacked in a pamphlet by Karl Twesten (1820–1870), a Liberal leader, whom he had wounded in a duel, for which Manteuffel insisted on being briefly imprisoned. He was promoted to  lieutenant-general for the coronation of William I on 18 October 1861 and saw active service in that rank in the Danish War of 1864, then at its conclusion was appointed civil and military governor of Schleswig. In the Austrian War of 1866 he first occupied Holstein and afterwards commanded a division under Vogel von Falkenstein in the Hanoverian campaign, then in July succeeded Vogel in command of the Army of the Main. Manteuffel's successful campaign ended with the occupation of Würzburg, and he received the order Pour le Mérite. However, on account of his monarchist political views throughout the political crises of the 1860s, and of his almost bigoted Roman Catholicism, he was regarded by Liberal politicians as a reactionary, and, unlike the other army commanders, he was not granted a financial reward for his services. He then went on a diplomatic mission to St Petersburg, where he was persona grata, and gained Russia's acquiescence to Prussia's domination of north Germany. On his return he was made honorary colonel of the 5th Dragoon Regiment. He was appointed to the command of the IX (Schleswig-Holstein) Corps in 1866. But having previously exercised both civil and military control in the Elbe duchies he was unwilling to be a purely military commander under one of his former civil subordinates, and retired from the army for a year. In 1868, however, Manteuffel returned to active service and on 18 September 1869 he received the Grand Cross of the Order of the Red Eagle. In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 he commanded the I Corps under Steinmetz, distinguishing himself in the Battle of Borny-Colombey, and in the repulse of Bazaine at Noisseville. In October he succeeded Steinmetz in the command of the 1st Army, won the Battle of Amiens against Général de brigade Jean-Joseph Farre, and occupied Rouen. However he was less fortunate against Faidherbe at Pont Noyelles and Bapaume. In January 1871 he commanded the newly formed Army of the South, which he led, in spite of hard frost, through the Côte-d'Or and over the plateau of Langres, cut off Bourbaki's Army of the East with 80,000 men, and, after the action of Pontarlier, compelled it to cross the Swiss frontier, where it was disarmed. His immediate reward was the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross, and at the conclusion of peace he was made a member of the Order of the Black Eagle. When the Southern Army was disbanded Manteuffel commanded the Second Army and, from June 1871 until 1873, the army of occupation left in France, showing great tact in a difficult position. At the close of the occupation, the Emperor promoted Manteuffel to the rank of Field Marshal and awarded him a large financial grant, and about the same time Alexander II of Russia gave him the Order of St. Andrew. After this he was employed on several diplomatic missions, was for a time Governor of Berlin, and in 1879—perhaps, as was commonly reported, because he was considered by Bismarck as a formidable rival—he was appointed Imperial Lieutenant of occupied Alsace–Lorraine. He is remembered in Alsace–Lorraine as a very humane, cultivated man, and as a conciliator whose fairness was often abused by some dominant figures. Opening the first session of the Landesausschuss (the regional assembly of Alsace–Lorraine), he announced his firm intention to gain full autonomy for Alsace–Lorraine, so that it could become a fully-fledged state of the German Empire. He died at Karlsbad, Bohemia, in 1885, still in office but without having achieved his aim. He received the following orders and decorations: Attribution:","A military leader, born in the early 19th century, was known for his significant role in a major European conflict and his position as the first regional governor of a contested territory from the late 1870s until his death. The son of a high-ranking judicial official, he was raised in a prominent city and grew up alongside a cousin who became a notable statesman. He joined the cavalry in a major city in the late 1820s, quickly rising through the ranks. After attending a military academy, he served as an aide to several high-ranking officials and gained the trust of a monarch during a period of political upheaval. Over the years, he was promoted through various military ranks and sent on important diplomatic missions to major European capitals. He supported military reforms and was involved in a public controversy with a political leader, resulting in a brief imprisonment. He participated in several military campaigns, earning recognition for his leadership and receiving prestigious military honors. Despite his achievements, his political views and religious beliefs led to mixed perceptions among political figures. He continued to serve in various military and diplomatic roles, eventually commanding an army during a significant war, where he achieved notable victories. After the war, he was promoted to a high military rank and received honors from foreign leaders. He later served as a regional governor, where he was known for his fair and humane approach, advocating for greater autonomy for the region he governed. He passed away in the mid-1880s, still holding office but without realizing his goal of full autonomy for the region. Throughout his career, he received numerous orders and decorations for his service.","The individual described fits the profile of Mikhail Skobelev, a prominent Russian military leader known for his role in the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878) and his governorship in Central Asia. Skobelev was known for his military prowess, diplomatic missions, and advocacy for reforms. His career was marked by significant military achievements and honors, as well as a reputation for fair governance. The timeline and details of his life, such as his rise through military ranks, involvement in European conflicts, and governorship, align with Skobelev's historical contributions."
Otto von Manteuffel,yes,Otto von Bismarck,"Otto von Manteuffel was a Prussian statesman in the 19th century, known for serving as the Minister President of Prussia from 1850 to 1858.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Theodor_von_Manteuffel,"Otto Theodor Freiherr von Manteuffel (3 February 1805 – 26 November 1882) was a conservative Prussian statesman, serving nearly a decade as prime minister. Born into an aristocratic family in Lübben (Spreewald), Manteuffel attended the Landesschule Pforta from 1819. In 1824–1827, he studied jurisprudence and cameralism at the University of Halle, where he joined the Corps Saxonia Halle, a duelling Studentenverbindung in the Kösener Senioren-Convents-Verband (""KSCV""). In 1830, Manteuffel commenced his clerkship in law.  He became a Landrat (local administrator) of the district of Luckau in 1833; in 1841, he was promoted to Oberregierungsrat (a senior administrative position) in Königsberg, and in 1843 he was made Vice-President of the government in Stettin.  In 1844, the Prince of Prussia, who was then the head of the Ministry of State, appointed him there as an expert councillor (vortragender Rat). Soon thereafter he was also made a member of the royal Council of State. He worked in the field of finance until in 1845 he was made Director at the Ministry of the Interior. The Vereinigte Landtag of 1847 (an assembly of the members of Prussia's provincial legislatures) gave him an opportunity to demonstrate his parliamentary skills, whereupon Manteuffel showed himself a champion of the bureaucratic political system and an opponent of constitutional liberalism. On November 8, 1848, Manteuffel entered the cabinet of Friedrich Wilhelm, Count Brandenburg, receiving the portfolio of the Ministry of the Interior.  For the next ten years, he held various positions in the government and was high in the favor of King Friedrich Wilhelm IV. Manteuffel had a major part in drafting the Prussian constitution of 5 December 1848. But it was also he who contributed to the announcement of 7 January 1850, which repealed significant provisions of that constitution; he also defended it in Parliament. During his career in the post-revolution Prussian government, Manteuffel proved an important reformer whose changes were of crucial historical importance. He conceived of the purpose of government as being a mediating entity for the ""conflicting interests"" within Prussian civil society. In pursuing this mediation position, Manteuffel often came into conflict with the conservative and ultra-conservative members of the parliamentary government, whom he found unwilling to fully embrace the new constitutional order. He stressed that gone were the days in which the Prussian state should act, in his own words, 'like the landed estate of a nobleman.' He faced this opposition head on. However, Manteuffel's efforts to impose a more structured decision making apparatus within the royal palace was halted by the ultra-conservatives who, due to their high aristocratic status, traditionally had the most direct contact with the king. There was a greater degree of success to be found in Manteuffel's other efforts, however. One of these was directed at creating a less regulated economy. In 1856, as Minister-President, he oversaw government policy removing state controls over the ""flow of credit to financial institutions"" and limiting supervisory powers within the iron and coal industries. Manteuffel also enjoyed success in his efforts to give the Prussian state a much more hands-off stance toward the press. This was a necessary step due to the increased antagonism between these two entities in recent years. Switching from a policy of outright censorship, after 1848 the Prussian state began imposing hefty penalties on publications which printed material damaging to state interests. Responding to increasing pressure to find a different press policy, Manteuffel decided to diminish the confrontational nature of the government stance. The government no longer directly censored or attacked the press but instead joined the printed debate through the placement of ""government friendly-articles in key journals."" This was a major shift in the relationship between press and state in Prussia. Instead of imposing regulations from above, the government operated in the arena of the press itself. Manteuffel was thus very much aware of the need to face rather than repress the power of the press which, in his words, '[had] grown with the expanded participation of the people in public affairs.' When he was temporarily entrusted with managing foreign affairs after the Count of Brandenburg died, he took part in the negotiations for the Agreement of Olmütz in November 1850, and surrendered the constitutional rights of Kurhessen and Holstein to the Austrian restoration zeal. ""The strong man takes a step back""; these were the words with which he sought to calm the members of the recently re-established Bundestag who were unhappy with these measures. On 19 December 1850 he was permanently appointed Prussian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, in which function he took part in the negotiations for the Treaty of Paris of 1856. He remained in this post until October 1858, when the king gave up the throne, and the Prince of Prussia (afterwards Emperor William the Great) became regent. On 6 November, he and the entire cabinet were dismissed. He thereupon withdrew to his estate in Lausitz, and after being elected by Görlitz entered the Prussian House of Representatives, but did not participate in the proceedings in any spectacular way. From 1864 he was a member of the Prussian House of Lords. On 6 February 1850, he was made an honorary citizen of Berlin, and the Manteuffelstraße in Kreuzberg was named after him. In the southern part of Wlhelmshaven, another Manteuffelstraße was opened on 17 June 1869 in the presence of King Wilhelm I. By the street lay the Manteuffelplatz (Exerzierplatz). He was also an honorary citizen of Danzig, Brandenburg an der Havel, Stettin and all the towns of the Niederlausitz. He died at Gut Krossen in Luckau in Niederlausitz.","A statesman from a conservative background, born in a small town, served as a prime minister for nearly a decade. Coming from an aristocratic family, he attended a prestigious school and later studied law and administration at a university, where he joined a student association. He began his career in law and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a local administrator and later holding senior administrative positions in various districts. He was appointed as an expert councillor and became a member of the royal council, working primarily in finance before becoming a director at the Ministry of the Interior. His parliamentary skills were recognized during an assembly, where he opposed constitutional liberalism. He joined the cabinet, holding various government positions and was favored by the king. He played a significant role in drafting a constitution but also contributed to its amendment, defending it in Parliament. As a reformer, he aimed to mediate conflicting interests within society, often clashing with conservative members of the government. He advocated for a less regulated economy and a more hands-off approach toward the press, shifting from censorship to engaging in public debate. He temporarily managed foreign affairs, participating in significant negotiations and treaties. He was appointed as Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, serving until the king abdicated, after which he retired to his estate. He was elected to the House of Representatives but did not actively participate. Later, he became a member of the House of Lords. He was honored as a citizen in several cities, with streets named after him. He passed away at his estate.","The individual's background and career trajectory closely resemble that of Otto von Bismarck. Bismarck was a statesman from a conservative and aristocratic background, who served as the Prime Minister of Prussia and later the first Chancellor of the German Empire. He was known for his skills in diplomacy and statecraft, particularly in finance and foreign affairs. Bismarck played a significant role in drafting and amending the constitution of the German Empire, and he was known for his pragmatic approach to governance, often mediating between different political interests. His tenure saw significant reforms and he was a key figure in European politics during his time, much like the individual described."
Eduard Vogel von Falckenstein,no,Eduard Vogel von Falckenstein,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_Vogel_von_Falckenstein,"Eduard Ernst Friedrich Hannibal Vogel von Fal(c)kenstein (5 January 1797 – 6 April 1885) was a Prussian General der Infanterie. Vogel von Falckenstein was born in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland) in Silesia, the son of Hannibal Vogel von Falckenstein (1750–1808). On 9 April 1829, he married Luise Gärtner (21 January 1813–24 August 1892) in Treuenbrietzen. His oldest son, Maximilian, also became a Prussian general. After a preliminary education, Falckenstein entered the Prussian Army as a volunteer Jäger in 1813 during the Sixth Coalition, distinguishing himself at Montmirail. Promoted to major in 1841, he was wounded during street fighting in Berlin during the revolutions of 1848. Falckenstein fought in Holstein during the First Schleswig War, becoming the commander of the Garde-Schützen-Bataillon. He was named Chief of Staff of the III. Armeekorps in 1850. Falckenstein was promoted to Oberst in 1851 and major general in 1855. He served as Director of the Military Economics Department from 1856–58; in the latter year he was promoted to lieutenant general, and placed in command of the V. Armeekorps. At the beginning of the Second Schleswig War, Falckenstein served as Friedrich Graf von Wrangel's chief of staff, but was replaced by Helmuth von Moltke after Edwin Freiherr von Manteuffel pressured the Prussian Minister of War, Albrecht von Roon. He was awarded the Pour le Mérite on 22 April 1864, and named Governor of Jutland on 30 April. He received chief command of the VII. Armeekorps after the war and was promoted to general in 1865. The Austro-Prussian War broke out in 1866, and Falckenstein commanded Prussia's forces in western Germany. While the bulk of the Prussian Army invaded Saxony and Bohemia to fight the Austrian Empire, Falckenstein's troops were to deal with Austria's allies: north of the Main River were troops of Hanover and Hesse-Kassel, while south of the Main were forces of Bavaria, Baden, Württemberg, and Hesse-Darmstadt. At his disposal, Falckenstein had three divisions of troops, many of whom were not front-line soldiers, consisting instead of Prussian Landwehr, garrison troops, or north German allies. Beginning on 15 June, the ""Corps Manteuffel"" division and the Goeben Division invaded Hanover, while Beyer Division at Wetzlar invaded Hesse-Kassel. While the cities of Hanover and Kassel fell to the Prussians, the armies of each state fled in an attempt to unite with the Bavarians, who were slowly advancing northward and reluctant to cross the Main. Falckenstein's leadership was mediocre during the campaign. The Hanoverian and Hessian troops systematically destroyed the railways during their retreat, while Falckenstein delayed in pursuing them, preferring instead to let his troops rest in Hanover. He eventually directed his three divisions to Göttingen, even after learning that Austria's allies had abandoned the city. Moltke ordered Falckenstein to finish off the Hanoverian Army, but Falckenstein wanted to let a lack of supplies force Major General Friedrich von Arentschildt and King George V of Hanover to surrender. After losing contact with the Hanoverians on 22 June and upon the advice of Otto von Bismarck, Falckenstein began marching south to Frankfurt to prevent a union of the disorganized forces of the German Confederation. Moltke and King William I of Prussia were furious with Bismarck's interference and Falckenstein's slowness, ordering the general to attack the Hanoverians vigorously. Arentschildt's army suffered greatly from their lack of supplies, however, and were cornered at Langensalza in Prussian Saxony by the advance of Falckenstein's three divisions from the north and, organized by Moltke, 9,000 troops under General Eduard von Flies from Gotha to the south. Falckenstein began preparing to attack Arentschildt's Hanoverian army after receiving a royal directive from William I. Flies, however, despite being outnumbered two to one, advanced on his own initiative against Arenttschildt on 27 June. Flies' Prussians were defeated in the Battle of Langensalza, but the Hanoverians were unable to capitalize on their victory. Falckenstein's troops arrived the following day, and Arentschildt was forced to flee eastward into territory ringed by Prussian railways, leading to Hanover's surrender at Nordhausen on 29 June. Falckenstein's forces fought a series of engagements against south German states and entered Frankfurt on 16 July. Because of differences with the Prussian General Staff, he was forced to relinquish command to von Manteuffel and instead was made governor of Bohemia. In 1867, Falckenstein was chosen as a representative of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia) to the Reichstag of the North German Confederation. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, Falckenstein was Generalgouverneur der deutschen Küstenlande (General Governor of the German Coastal Lands) and resided in Hanover. He organized the German coastal defenses and created a volunteer Seewehr as a naval militia. Falckenstein retired in 1873. He died at Dolzig (now Dłużek, Poland), then in the Province of Brandenburg.","Eduard Ernst Friedrich Hannibal Vogel von Falckenstein (5 January 1797 – 6 April 1885) was a Prussian General der Infanterie. Vogel von Falckenstein was born in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland) in Silesia, the son of Hannibal Vogel von Falckenstein (1750–1808). On 9 April 1829, he married Luise Gärtner (21 January 1813–24 August 1892) in Treuenbrietzen. His oldest son, Maximilian, also became a Prussian general. After a preliminary education, Falckenstein entered the Prussian Army as a volunteer Jäger in 1813 during the Sixth Coalition, distinguishing himself at Montmirail. Promoted to major in 1841, he was wounded during street fighting in Berlin during the revolutions of 1848. Falckenstein fought in Holstein during the First Schleswig War, becoming the commander of the Garde-Schützen-Bataillon. He was named Chief of Staff of the III. Armeekorps in 1850. Falckenstein was promoted to Oberst in 1851 and major general in 1855. He served as Director of the Military Economics Department from 1856–58; in the latter year he was promoted to lieutenant general, and placed in command of the V. Armeekorps. At the beginning of the Second Schleswig War, Falckenstein served as Friedrich Graf von Wrangel's chief of staff, but was replaced by Helmuth von Moltke after Edwin Freiherr von Manteuffel pressured the Prussian Minister of War, Albrecht von Roon. He was awarded the Pour le Mérite on 22 April 1864, and named Governor of Jutland on 30 April. He received chief command of the VII. Armeekorps after the war and was promoted to general in 1865. The Austro-Prussian War broke out in 1866, and Falckenstein commanded Prussia's forces in western Germany. While the bulk of the Prussian Army invaded Saxony and Bohemia to fight the Austrian Empire, Falckenstein's troops were to deal with Austria's allies: north of the Main River were troops of Hanover and Hesse-Kassel, while south of the Main were forces of Bavaria, Baden, Württemberg, and Hesse-Darmstadt. At his disposal, Falckenstein had three divisions of troops, many of whom were not front-line soldiers, consisting instead of Prussian Landwehr, garrison troops, or north German allies. Beginning on 15 June, the ""Corps Manteuffel"" division and the Goeben Division invaded Hanover, while Beyer Division at Wetzlar invaded Hesse-Kassel. While the cities of Hanover and Kassel fell to the Prussians, the armies of each state fled in an attempt to unite with the Bavarians, who were slowly advancing northward and reluctant to cross the Main. Falckenstein's leadership was mediocre during the campaign. The Hanoverian and Hessian troops systematically destroyed the railways during their retreat, while Falckenstein delayed in pursuing them, preferring instead to let his troops rest in Hanover. He eventually directed his three divisions to Göttingen, even after learning that Austria's allies had abandoned the city. Moltke ordered Falckenstein to finish off the Hanoverian Army, but Falckenstein wanted to let a lack of supplies force Major General Friedrich von Arentschildt and King George V of Hanover to surrender. After losing contact with the Hanoverians on 22 June and upon the advice of Otto von Bismarck, Falckenstein began marching south to Frankfurt to prevent a union of the disorganized forces of the German Confederation. Moltke and King William I of Prussia were furious with Bismarck's interference and Falckenstein's slowness, ordering the general to attack the Hanoverians vigorously.

Friedrich Graf von Wrangel,yes,Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim,"Friedrich Graf von Wrangel was a Prussian field marshal known for his military leadership during the 19th century, particularly in the German revolutions of 1848 and the Austro-Prussian War.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Graf_von_Wrangel,"Friedrich Heinrich Ernst Graf von Wrangel (13 April 1784 – 2 November 1877) was a Generalfeldmarschall of the Prussian Army. A Baltic German, he was nicknamed ""Papa Wrangel"" and was a member of the Baltic noble family of Wrangel. Wrangel was born in Stettin (now Szczecin, Poland) in Pomerania into the Wrangel family. He was actually a relative uncle to the world-famous explorer Ferdinand von Wrangel. He entered a dragoon regiment in 1796 and became second lieutenant in 1798. He fought as a subaltern during the Napoleonic Wars, distinguishing himself especially at Heilsberg in 1807 and receiving the order Pour le Mérite. In the reorganization of the army, Wrangel became first lieutenant and then captain; won distinction and promotion to lieutenant-colonel in the War of Liberation in 1813; won the Iron Cross at Wachau, near Leipzig; and became colonel in 1815. Wrangel commanded a cavalry brigade in 1821, and two years later, he was promoted to major-general. He commanded the 13th Division, with headquarters at Münster, in Westphalia, in 1834 during riots caused by differences between the Archbishop of Cologne and the Crown, and the determination and the resolution with which he treated the clerical party prevented serious trouble. He was promoted to lieutenant-general, received many honours from the court, enjoyed the confidence of the Junkers and commanded at Königsberg and then Stettin. In 1848, Wrangel commanded the II Corps of the army of the German Confederation during the First Schleswig War, was promoted to General of Cavalry and won several battles. However, the other European powers pressured Prussia to withdraw its forces, and King Frederick William IV accordingly ordered Wrangel to withdraw his troops from the duchies. Wrangel refused by asserting that he was under the command of not the king of Prussia but the regent of Germany. He proposed that at the very least, any treaty concluded should be presented for ratification to the Frankfurt Parliament, which was dominated by the liberals, which gave Liberals the rather mistaken idea that Wrangel was on their side. However, the Danes rejected that proposal, and negotiations were broken off, and after painful hesitation, Prussia signed a convention at Malmö that yielded to practically all of the Danish demands on 26 August 1848. Wrangel's insubordination was not counted against him when, in the autumn, he was summoned to Berlin to suppress its riots during the German revolutions of 1848–49. As governor of Berlin and commander-in-chief of Brandenburg (appointments that he held until his death), he proclaimed a state of siege and ejected the Liberal president and the members of the Chamber. Thus, on two occasions in the troubled history of Prussia's revival, Wrangel's uncompromising sternness achieved its object without bloodshed. From then on, Wrangel was most prominent in connection with the revival of the Prussian cavalry from the neglect and inefficiency into which it had fallen during the years of peace and poverty since 1815. In 1856, after 60 years of service, he was made a field marshal. At the age of 80, he commanded the Austro-Prussian army in the Second Schleswig War with Denmark in 1864. Wrangel was too old for active work and often issued vague or impracticable orders; he had always desired the young ""Red Prince"", Prince Frederick Charles of Prussia, to have the command. However, the prestige of Wrangel's name and the leadership of Frederick Charles, Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, Eduard Vogel von Falckenstein and Ludwig von Gablenz made the campaign an overwhelming success. After the Battle of Dybbøl, Wrangel resigned his command, was created a Graf (count), and received other honours. In 1866, ""Papa"" Wrangel assisted in the Austro-Prussian War but without a command on account of his great age. He took a keen interest in the second reorganisation of the cavalry army in 1866 to 1870, and in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 to 1871. He died in Berlin in 1877. On the 70th anniversary of his joining the army, Wrangel's regiment, the 3rd Cuirassiers, was given the title Graf Wrangel. A noteworthy Commander of this regiment was the Swedish Count Gilbert Hamilton who led the regiment during World War I. He received the following orders and decorations: Media related to Friedrich von Wrangel at Wikimedia Commons","A distinguished military leader, born in the late 1700s, served as a high-ranking officer in a northern European army. Known affectionately by a familial nickname, he hailed from a notable noble family in a region now part of a different country. He was related to a renowned explorer and began his military career in the late 18th century, quickly rising through the ranks. He earned recognition for his bravery in early 19th-century conflicts, receiving prestigious military honors. Throughout his career, he held various command positions, demonstrating decisive leadership during civil unrest and international conflicts. In the mid-19th century, he played a significant role in a regional war, although political pressures led to a strategic withdrawal. Despite occasional insubordination, his actions were often seen as instrumental in maintaining order without violence. Later, he contributed to the revitalization of the cavalry and was honored with a high military rank after decades of service. In his later years, he participated in another major conflict, though his advanced age limited his active involvement. He passed away in the late 19th century, leaving a legacy commemorated by his regiment, which was named in his honor. His life was marked by numerous accolades and decorations for his service.","The description fits Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, a prominent Finnish military leader and statesman. He was born into a noble family in the Russian Empire, which is now part of Finland.

Ferdinand von Wrangel,yes,Sir John Franklin,Ferdinand von Wrangel was a 19th-century Russian explorer and naval officer known for his Arctic expeditions and exploration of the Siberian coast.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_von_Wrangel,"Baron Ferdinand Friedrich Georg Ludwig von Wrangel (Russian: Барон Фердинанд Петрович Врангель, tr. Ferdinand Petrovich Vrangel'; 9 January 1797 [O.S. 29 December 1796] – 6 June [O.S. 25 May] 1870) was a Russia German (Baltic German) explorer and officer in the Imperial Russian Navy, Honorable Member of the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences, and a founder of the Russian Geographic Society. He is best known as the chief manager of the Russian-American Company and governor of the Russian settlements in present-day Alaska. In English texts, Wrangel is sometimes spelled Vrangel, a transliteration from Russian, which more closely represents its pronunciation in German, or Wrangell. Wrangel was born in Pskov, into the Baltic German nobility of the Wrangel family and was a distant nephew of Generalfeldmarschall Friedrich von Wrangel. He graduated from the Naval Cadets College in 1815. He participated in Vasily Golovnin's world cruise on the ship Kamchatka in 1817–1819 and belonged to the cohort of Baltic-German navigators who were instrumental in Imperial Russia's maritime explorations. He was appointed in 1820 to command the Kolymskaya expedition to explore the Russian polar seas. Sailing from St. Petersburg, he arrived at Nizhnekolymsk on 2 November 1820, and early in 1821 journeyed to Cape Shelagskiy on sledges drawn by dogs. He sailed afterward up Kolyma River, advancing about 125 miles into the interior, through territory inhabited by the Yakuts. On 10 March 1822, he resumed his journey northward, and traveled 46 days on the ice, reaching 72° 2' north latitude. He left Nizhnekolymsk on 1 November 1823, and returned to St. Petersburg on 15 August 1824. He established that north of the Kolyma River and Cape Shelagsky there was an open sea, not dry land, as people thought. Together with Fyodor Matyushkin and P. Kuzmin, Wrangel described the Siberian coastline from the Indigirka River to the Kolyuchinskaya Bay in the Chukchi Sea. (See Northeast Passage.) His expedition made a valuable research in glaciology, geomagnetics, and climatology and also collected data about natural resources and native population of that remote area. Having been promoted to commander, Wrangel led the Russian world voyage on the ship Krotky in 1825–1827. That voyage spent 8 days at Nuku Hiva, leaving when it was ambushed by local people.  It also called at Hawai'i. He was appointed chief manager of the Russian-American Company in 1829, effectively governor of its settlements in North America (present day Alaska).  Wrangel was the first of a series of bachelor appointees to the office of governor who had to find a wife before assuming the duties in America, the Russian American Company rules having been changed in 1829. Prior to his departure for Russia's American colonies, he was married to Elisabeth Theodora Natalie Karoline de Rossillon, daughter of Baron Wilhelm de Rossillon. He traveled to his post early in 1829, by way of Siberia and Kamchatka. After thoroughly reforming the administration, he introduced the cultivation of the potato, opened and regulated the working of several mines, and urged upon the home government the organization of a fur company. He promoted investment, and sent out missionaries. He began a survey of the country, opened roads, built bridges and government buildings. He made geographical and ethnographical observations, which he embodied in a memoir to the navy department. Recalled in 1834, he returned by way of Mexico and the United States, where he visited several cities. Wrangel was promoted to rear admiral in 1837, and made director of the ship-timber department in the navy office, which he held for twelve years. He became vice-admiral in 1847, but resigned in 1849, and temporarily severed his connection with the navy to assume the presidency of the newly reorganized Russian-American Company. Wrangel had been a member of the board of directors of the Russian-American Company from 1840 to 1849. In 1854 he re-entered active service and was made chief director of the hydrographical department of the navy  He was the Minister of the Navy 1855–1857. Wrangel retired in 1864. He opposed the sale of Alaska to the United States in 1867. Wrangel wrote the book Journey along the northern coastline of Siberia and the Arctic Ocean and other books about the peoples of northwestern America. He lived in his last years in Ruil (Roela in Estonian) in the eastern part of Estonia. The manor was bought by him in 1840 and he gave it to his wife as a gift. Wrangel died in Dorpat, Livonia. His final resting place is in Viru-Jaagupi cemetery. An account of the physical observations during his first journey was published in German (Berlin, 1827), and also in German extracts from Wrangel's journals, Reise längs der Nordküste von Sibirien und auf dem Eismeere in den Jahren 1820-1824 (2 vols., Berlin, 1839), which was translated into English as Wrangell's Expedition to the Polar Sea (2 vols., London, 1840). The complete report of the expedition appeared as ""Puteshestvie po severnym beregam Sibiri, po Ledovitomu Moryu, sovershennoe v 1820, 1821, 1822, 1823 i 1824 godakh"" (2 vols., St. Petersburg, 1841), and was translated into French with notes by Prince Galitzin, under the title Voyage sur les côtes septentrionales de la Sibérie et de la mer glaciale (2 vols., 1841). From the French version of the complete report an English one was made under the title A Journey on the Northern Coast of Siberia and the Icy Sea (2 vols., London, 1841). The book influenced Charles Darwin's thinking on animal navigation, leading him to propose that humans and animals possess an innate ability for dead reckoning. Darwin wrote: With regard to the question of the means by which animals find their way home from a long distance, a striking account, in relation to man, will be found in the English translation of the Expedition to North Siberia, by Von Wrangell.  He there describes the wonderful manner in which the natives kept a true cou","Baron Ferdinand was a notable explorer and officer in the navy of a large empire, recognized for his contributions to geographic and scientific exploration. Born into a noble family, he embarked on numerous expeditions, including a significant journey to the polar seas. His work involved mapping coastlines, studying natural resources, and interacting with indigenous populations. He held various leadership roles, including managing a company responsible for settlements in a distant territory, where he implemented agricultural and administrative reforms. His travels took him across continents, and he was involved in the development of infrastructure and scientific research. He opposed the sale of a significant territory to another nation and authored several works on his explorations, which influenced contemporary scientific thought. He spent his later years in a manor he purchased, where he eventually passed away. His writings were translated into multiple languages, contributing to the broader understanding of navigation and exploration.","The description matches Sir John Franklin, a British Royal Navy officer and explorer of the Arctic. Franklin was known for his expeditions to the polar regions, particularly his ill-fated final expedition to find the Northwest Passage. He was involved in mapping coastlines and interacting with indigenous populations, similar to the description. Franklin's leadership roles and his opposition to certain territorial decisions also align with the narrative. His contributions to exploration and navigation were significant, and his works were influential in the field of geographic exploration."
Vasily Golovnin,yes,Vasily Golovnin,"Vasily Golovnin was a Russian navigator and explorer in the early 19th century, known for his voyages in the Pacific and his imprisonment in Japan.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasily_Golovnin,"Vasily Mikhailovich Golovnin (Russian: Василий Михайлович Головнин; 19 April [O.S. 8 April] 1776, Gulyniki, Ryazan Oblast – 11 July [O.S. 29 June] 1831, Saint Petersburg) was a Russian navigator, Vice Admiral, and corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences (1818). Vasily Mikhailovich Golovnin was born in April 1776, in the village of Gulyniki in Ryazan Oblast, on his father's country estate. Both his father and grandfather had served in the Russian military as officers in the elite Preobrazhensky Lifeguard regiment. Golovnin appeared set to continue the family tradition, but his father died while he was still a child, and at the age of twelve he was enrolled in the Russian Naval College as a cadet. He graduated four years later in 1792. Golovnin entered active service as a midshipman in May and June 1790, participating in several naval battles against the Swedes. He served in several foreign campaigns between 1793 and 1798. From 1798 to 1800 he served as adjutant and interpreter to Vice Admiral M. K. Makarov, commander of a Russian squadron operating jointly with the British fleet in the North Sea. On the orders of Tsar Alexander I, Golovnin was sent, along with several other Russian officers, to obtain further training aboard British ships. He served three years (1802–1805) with the British fleet under Admirals Nelson, Collingwood, and Cornwallis. During this period, war was once again declared between the British and French, and Golovnin saw action while serving under Admiral Nelson. He returned to Russia in 1806, and began compiling a code of naval signals on the English pattern, which remained in use by the Russian fleet for more than twenty years. Golovnin was given command of the sloop Diana in 1806, and made his first voyage around the world (1807—1809), with the object of conducting a survey of the northern Pacific, and transporting supplies to Okhotsk. Diana set sail from Kronstadt on 7 July 1807. A severe storm in April 1808 prevented Diana from sailing around Cape Horn, and Golovnin decided to set sail for the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, to restock the ship's supplies. He anchored in the nearby port of Simon's Town on 3 May 1808. Golovnin, having been at sea for ten months, was unaware that Russian relations with Britain had deteriorated, and Russia had allied herself with the French. Diana was immediately detained as an enemy vessel by a British naval squadron, pending receipt of appropriate instructions from London. Golovnin and his crew spent more than a year detained aboard Diana at Simon's Town awaiting a decision from British authorities. When it became increasingly clear that a decision might never come, Golovnin began to plot their escape. On 28 May 1809, perfect conditions presented themselves - a fair wind and poor visibility. The crew severed the anchor cables, and managed successfully to sail out of the bay, passing directly in front of several British warships. Once the British discovered that they had escaped, they set off in pursuit, but failed to overtake Diana, which sailed safely to Kamchatka in 1810, and news of Diana's ""audacious escape"" quickly spread throughout the world. Golovnin left Kamchatka in 1810, sailing to Baranof Island, a recently settled outpost of the Russian-American Company. In 1819, he published an account of their voyage, detention and escape, titled Journey of the Russian Emperor’s sloop Diana from Kronstadt to Kamchatka. In 1811, Golovnin described and mapped the Kuril Islands from the Strait of Hope to the eastern shores of Iturup Island (Etorofu in Japanese). While exploring Kunashir Island (Kunashiri in Japanese), he was lured ashore, taken prisoner, charged with violating Sakoku (a Japanese policy prohibiting foreigners from entering Japan), and held captive for two years by the Japanese on the island of Hokkaido. Golovnin was said to possess a ""superior education and fascination with foreign cultures."" After making one failed attempt to escape his captors, Golovnin decided to utilize his time in detainment to master the Japanese language, and familiarize himself with Japanese culture and traditions. Golovnin was released in 1813, returned to Russia, and published an account of his years in captivity. His book, Captivity in Japan During the Years 1811, 1812, 1813, became an instant classic. It was hailed in Russia as an authoritative volume on Japanese culture, and helped shape an entire generation's view of Japan. Golovnin clearly respected the Japanese, portraying them ""as intelligent, as patriotic, and as worthy rivals"" of the Russians in the Pacific. His representation of Japanese religious practices also became influential in Europe; he claimed that the Japanese practiced a form of Hinduism or Indian religion but a minority followed a distant, indigenous form of Christianity, influencing later scholars' claims about Japanese religion well into the 19th century. The captivity of Golovnin almost led to war between Russia and Japan in what became known as the Golovnin Incident. On 7 September 1817, Golovnin set out on a second voyage around the world aboard the frigate Kamchatka. Serving under him were three future Russian explorers of prominence - Fyodor Litke, Fyodor Matyushkin, and Ferdinand von Wrangel. After sailing around Cape Horn, the objective was to deliver supplies to Kamchatka, and survey previously unexplored islands along what is now the northwestern coast of Alaska. Golovnin was also tasked with compiling a report detailing relations between the Kodiak Islanders and employees of the Russian-American Company. He arrived in Kamchatka the following May, then returned to Europe via the Cape of Good Hope, completing his circumnavigation by landing at St Petersburg on 17 September 1819. After the journey, Golovnin published Around the World on the Kamchatka, describing his voyage, and his encounters with the native Kodiak and Sandwich Islanders. Though the journey had ""achieved little in the way of new","discoveries,"" it was considered a success for its detailed observations and contributions to navigation. Golovnin continued to serve in the naval forces, eventually rising to the rank of Vice Admiral. He was recognized for his contributions to maritime exploration and was made a corresponding member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1828. His legacy includes not only his navigational achievements but also his writings, which provided valuable insights into the cultures he encountered. Golovnin passed away in the early 1830s, leaving behind a legacy of exploration and cultural understanding.","The individual described is a naval officer who rose to the rank of Vice Admiral and was involved in maritime exploration. He is noted for his detailed observations and contributions to navigation, as well as his writings on the cultures he encountered. These details align with the life of Vasily Golovnin, a Russian naval officer and explorer known for his voyages and contributions to navigation and cultural understanding."
Karl Friedrich von Steinmetz,yes,Helmuth von Moltke the Elder,Karl Friedrich von Steinmetz was a Prussian field marshal known for his role in the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian Wars in the 19th century.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Friedrich_von_Steinmetz,"Karl Friedrich von Steinmetz (27 December 1796 – 2 August 1877) was a Prussian Generalfeldmarschall. He was born at Eisenach and joined the army of Prussia during the War of Liberation. Over the Seven Weeks' War he led the V Corps against Austria and became known as the Lion of Nachod for his victories as the Battles of Nachod, Skalitz, and Schweinschädel. Steinmetz commanded one of three armies assembled on the Rhine for the Franco-Prussian War, during which he quarreled with Prince Friedrich Karl. After the war he retired. Steinmetz was born at Eisenach on 27 December 1796 and was educated at the cadet school of Stolp in Pomerania from 1807 to 1811, in the midst of the misery and poverty caused by the French occupation. He showed great ability in military education. At the outbreak of the War of Liberation he and his elder brother made their way through the French positions to Breslau, where they were at once appointed to the army, the elder as ensign on probation, the younger to the substantive rank of second lieutenant. After a vain attempt to transfer to the Blücher Hussars, a regiment he had an intense boyish admiration for when it was quartered at Stolp, he was ordered to report to General Ludwig von Yorck, who treated him and the other officers from Breslau with coldness, until Steinmetz asked about returning to the king who had sent him. The brothers were in the hardest fighting of the campaign of 1813, the elder being killed at the Battle of Leipzig and the younger being wounded more than once. During the short halt on the Rhine he improved his military and general education. In the battles in France, he won the Iron Cross, Second Class. After the peace, he entered Paris only once, fearing to spend the ten ducats that sent monthly to his mother. For the same reason, he did not take part in the pleasures of his better-off comrades. Steinmetz's avoidance of youthful excesses helped him overcome bad health and become physically vigorous, which he was to the end of his military career. His character as well as his physique was strengthened by his Spartan way of life, but his temperament was embittered by the circumstances which imposed this self-restraint. His poverty and want of influence were the more obvious as he was, shortly after the wars, assigned to the lowly 2nd Foot Guards, stationed in Berlin. He rigorously devoted himself to study and his professional duties. From 1820 to 1824 he studied at the General War Academy, graduating from the course with distinction, and so was appointed to the topographical section of the general staff. General von Müffling reported that he was arrogant and resented encouragement, which he probably regarded as patronising, but that his ability would outdistance his comrades. Steinmetz was too poor to buy a good horse or a house, and he had to live in his regimental quarters. However, shortly after his marriage to his cousin Julie, the daughter of Lieutenant-General KKF von Steinmetz (1768–1837), gave him enough money to temper his resentment, since his father-in-law was generous to the young couple, and helped him get an appointment as captain at the Landwehr Guard at Potsdam. His brigade commander, General von Röder, was an excellent soldier, and Steinmetz often spoke of the thorough training he received. From 1830 his regimental work went on without incident in various garrisons, until in 1839 he was promoted to major given command of a battalion. In this position he had many differences with his superiors, for he urged strenuous training for the troops, in all seasons.  However, his off-duty relationships were extremely cordial, thanks chiefly to the social gifts of his wife. In 1848, he commanded a guard battalion during the disturbances in Berlin, but was not involved. The same year, he was sent to fight in the First Schleswig War. After the Battle of Schleswig, Wrangel, the commander-in-chief, told him that he had decided the battle. He distinguished himself again at Düppel, and Prince Wilhelm decorated him with the order Pour le Mérite. On returning to Germany, he was given the difficult command of troops at Brandenburg during the sitting of a democratic popular convention there, troops known to be affected by the revolution. During the Olmütz-Bronnzell incident of 1850, he was military governor of Cassel. In 1851, he became colonel commandant of the cadet school of Berlin, where he reformed the prevailing system of instruction, the defects of which he had condemned as early as 1820. Though more than fifty years of age, he learned Latin and English to be a more competent instructor. In 1854, after forty-one years of active service, he was promoted major-general. At Magdeburg, as at Berlin, his reforming zeal made him many enemies, and in October his youngest and only surviving child died at twenty-six, which affected him deeply. In 1857, he was posted to the command of a guard brigade at Berlin, and thence almost immediately to a divisional command in the I Corps. Early in 1858 he was promoted lieutenant-general, and for the five years that he held this command he devoted himself to cavalry. In 1863, learning that Adolf von Bonin, his senior by date of rank, but his junior in age and length of service, was to be appointed to the command of the I Corps, he considered retirement.  However, when Bonin took command, Steinmetz was given command of the II Corps. Shortly afterwards, the crown prince of Prussia Frederick William took over II Corps and Steinmetz went to command the V Corps at Posen. Soon after this his wife died. He was promoted to general of infantry in 1864, and led the V Corps in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. It was part of the Second Army of Crown Prince Frederick William. On 26 June 1866 Steinmetz and his reinforced corps were ready to enter Austrian territory as the advance guard of the army's left column. In the evening of that day the border was crossed on the road leading from Glatz to Bohemia via Reinerz. On the fol","Karl Friedrich von Steinmetz was a military leader born in a small town in the late 1700s. He joined the army during a significant war and gained fame for his leadership in several battles. Known for his strategic prowess, he commanded forces in a major conflict against a neighboring country and later played a key role in another war, where he had disagreements with a fellow commander. After the war, he retired from military service.  Steinmetz's early life was marked by hardship due to foreign occupation, but he excelled in military education. He and his brother joined the army, with the elder brother dying in a major battle. Steinmetz was recognized for his bravery and received a prestigious military award. Despite financial struggles, he focused on his studies and military duties, eventually attending a war academy where he graduated with honors.  His career was marked by a dedication to rigorous training and reform, which sometimes led to conflicts with superiors. He married a cousin, which improved his financial situation and helped him advance in his career. Steinmetz held various commands, including during a period of political unrest, and was recognized for his leadership in several military engagements. He continued to rise through the ranks, eventually commanding a corps in a significant war, where he demonstrated his tactical skills. Despite personal losses, including the death of his wife, he remained committed to his military duties until his retirement.","The description of Karl Friedrich von Steinmetz closely resembles the life of Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, a prominent Prussian military leader. Both figures were known for their strategic prowess and played significant roles in major conflicts involving Prussia. Moltke was involved in the Austro-Prussian War and the Franco-Prussian War, similar to the conflicts mentioned. The description of Steinmetz's disagreements with a fellow commander and his focus on military reform and education also align with Moltke's career. Additionally, the personal hardships and dedication to military service are consistent with Moltke's life story."

Heinrich von Heß,no,Helmuth von Moltke the Elder,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_von_He%C3%9F,"Heinrich Hermann Josef Freiherr von Heß (alternatively: von Hess) (17 March 1788, Vienna – 13 April 1870, Vienna), was an Austrian soldier and field marshal, who entered the army in 1805 and was soon employed as a staff officer on survey work.  He distinguished himself as a subaltern at Aspern and Wagram, and in 1813, as captain, again served on the staff. In 1815, he was with Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg. He had, in the interval between the two wars, been employed as a military commissioner in Piedmont, and at the peace resumed this post, gaining knowledge which later prover invaluable to the Austrian army.  In 1831, when Radetzky became commander-in-chief in Austrian Italy, he took Heß as his chief of staff. This began the connection between two famous soldiers which, like that of Blücher and Gneisenau, is a classical example of harmonious co-operation between commander and chief of staff. Heß put into shape Radetzky's military ideas, in the form of new drill for each army, and, under their guidance, the Austrian army in North Italy, always on a war footing, became the best in Europe. From 1834 to 1848 Heß was employed in Moravia, at Vienna, etc., but, on the outbreak of revolution and war in the latter year, he was at once sent out to Radetzky as chief of staff.  In the two campaigns against King Charles Albert which followed, culminating in the victory of Novara, Heß's assistance to his chief was made still more valuable by his knowledge of the enemy, and the old field-marshal acknowledged his services in general orders. Lieut.-Fieldmarshal Heß was at once promoted Feldzeugmeister, made a member of the emperor's council, and Freiherr von Heß assumed at the same time the duties of quartermaster-general. Next year he became chief of the staff to the emperor.  He was often employed in missions to various capitals, and he appeared in the field in 1854 at the head of the Austrian army which intervened so effectually in the Crimean War. In 1859 he was sent to the Second Italian War of Independence after the early defeats. He became field-marshal in 1860, and a year later, on resigning his position as chief of staff, he was made captain of the Trabant guard. He died in Vienna in 1870.","A soldier and field marshal, born in the late 1700s in a city known for its cultural heritage, began his military career in the early 1800s. He quickly rose through the ranks, distinguishing himself in several key battles. By the early 1800s, he was serving under a prominent military leader. Between conflicts, he gained valuable experience as a military commissioner in a region known for its strategic importance. In the early 1830s, he became the chief of staff to a renowned commander, forming a legendary partnership that transformed their army into one of the best in the continent. Throughout the 1830s and 1840s, he held various important positions, and during a period of revolution and war, he was called back to serve as chief of staff. His expertise was crucial in several campaigns, leading to significant victories. He was promoted and took on additional responsibilities, eventually becoming a key advisor to the ruler. He was involved in diplomatic missions and played a significant role in a major mid-19th-century conflict.

Karl Philipp Prince of Schwarzenberg,yes,"Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg","Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, was an Austrian field marshal who played a significant role in the Napoleonic Wars, particularly known for leading the Austrian army at the Battle of Leipzig in 1813.","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Philipp,_Prince_of_Schwarzenberg","Karl Philipp, Fürst zu Schwarzenberg (or Charles Philip, Prince of Schwarzenberg; 18/19 April 1771 – 15 October 1820) was an Austrian Generalissimo and former Field Marshal. He first entered military service in 1788 and fought against the Turks. During the French Revolutionary War, he fought on the allied side against France and in that period rose through the ranks of the Imperial Army. During the Napoleonic Wars, he fought in the Battle of Wagram (1809), which the Austrians lost decisively against Napoleon. He had to fight for Napoleon in the Battle of Gorodechno (1812) against the Russians and won. During the War of the Sixth Coalition, he was in command of the allied army that decisively defeated Napoleon in the Battle of Leipzig (1813). He participated in the Battle of Paris (1814), which forced Napoleon to abdicate.  Schwarzenberg is well-remembered for his participation in the wars against Napoleon from 1803 to 1815. During the War of the Sixth Coalition to defeat Napoleon, Schwarzenberg was a pioneer of the Trachenberg Plan which led to the success at the Battle of Leipzig and later the campaigns against Napoleon on French soil. During the latter stage of the war he won many victories that garnered him fame and reputation as a military commander, particularly during his campaigns in Germany, Switzerland, and France during the war in 1814. In the years following the war, Schwarzenberg served as a diplomat for the Austrian Empire and later went on to serve as Austrian ambassador to Russia and also represented Austria at the Congress of Vienna.","A prominent military leader, born in the late 1700s, served as a high-ranking officer in a central European empire. He began his military career in the late 1780s, initially fighting against the Ottomans. During the conflicts of the late 18th century, he opposed a major European power and advanced within the ranks of the imperial forces. In the early 1800s, he participated in a significant battle where his side was defeated by a renowned French leader. Later, he was compelled to fight alongside this leader against another major power and achieved victory. During a coalition war, he commanded allied forces that decisively defeated the French leader in a pivotal battle. He also took part in a battle that led to the French leader's abdication. This military figure is remembered for his role in the wars against the French leader from the early to mid-1800s. He was instrumental in a strategic plan that contributed to success in a major battle and subsequent campaigns on foreign soil. In the later stages of the war, he achieved numerous victories, enhancing his reputation as a commander, particularly during campaigns in various European regions in the mid-1810s. After the war, he served as a diplomat for his empire, later becoming an ambassador to a major northern power and representing his empire at a significant international congress.","The individual described is a prominent military leader from the late 1700s to the early 1800s, involved in significant battles against and alongside Napoleon. The description matches Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, who was a high-ranking officer in the Austrian Empire.

Jean Victor Marie Moreau,yes,Napoleon Bonaparte,"Jean Victor Marie Moreau was a French general who served during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, known for his opposition to Napoleon Bonaparte.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Victor_Marie_Moreau,"Jean Victor Marie Moreau (French pronunciation: [ʒɑ̃ viktɔʁ maʁi mɔʁo], 14 February 1763 – 2 September 1813) was a French general who helped Napoleon Bonaparte rise to power, but later became his chief military and political rival and was banished to the United States. He is among the foremost French generals in military history. Moreau was born at Morlaix in Brittany. His father was a successful lawyer, and instead of allowing Moreau to enter the army, as he attempted to do, insisted on Moreau studying law at the University of Rennes. Young Moreau showed no inclination for law, but reveled in the freedom of student life. Instead of taking his degree, he continued to live with the students as their hero and leader, and formed them into a sort of army, which he commanded as their provost. When 1789 came, he commanded the students in the daily affrays which took place at Rennes between the young noblesse and the populace. In 1791, Moreau was elected a lieutenant colonel of the volunteers of Ille-et-Vilaine. With them he served under Charles François Dumouriez, and in 1793 the good order of his battalion, and his own martial character and republican principles, secured his promotion as général de brigade. Lazare Carnot promoted Moreau to be général de division early in 1794, and gave him command of the right wing of the army under Charles Pichegru, in Flanders. The 1794 Battle of Tourcoing established Moreau's military fame, and in 1795 he was given the command of the Army of the Rhine and Moselle, with which he crossed the Rhine and advanced into Germany. He was at first completely successful and won several victories and penetrated to the Isar, but at last had to retreat before the Archduke Charles of Austria. However, the skill he displayed in conducting his retreat—which was considered a model for such operations—greatly enhanced his own reputation, the more so as he managed to bring back with him more than 5000 prisoners. In 1797, after prolonged difficulties caused by want of funds and materiel, he crossed the Rhine again, but his operations were checked by the conclusion of the preliminaries of Peace of Leoben between Bonaparte and the Austrians. It was at this time he found a traitorous correspondence between his old comrade and commander Charles Pichegru and the émigré Prince de Condé. He had already appeared as Pichegru's defender against imputations of disloyalty, and now he foolishly concealed his discovery, with the result that he has ever since been suspected of at least partial complicity. Too late to clear himself, he sent the correspondence to Paris and issued a proclamation to the army denouncing Pichegru as a traitor. Moreau was dismissed, and only re-employed in 1799, when the absence of Bonaparte and the victorious advance of the Russian commander Aleksandr Suvorov made it necessary to have some tried and experienced general in Italy. He commanded the Army of Italy, with little success, for a short time before being appointed to the Army of the Rhine, and remained with Barthelemy Catherine Joubert, his successor in Italy, until the Battle of Novi had been fought and lost. Joubert fell in the battle, and Moreau then conducted the retreat of the army to Genoa, where he handed over the command to Jean Étienne Championnet. When Bonaparte returned from the French campaign in Egypt and Syria, he found Moreau in Paris, greatly dissatisfied with the French Directory government both as a general and as a republican, and obtained his assistance in the coup d'état of 18 Brumaire, when Moreau commanded the force which confined two of the directors in the Luxembourg Palace. In reward, Napoleon again gave him command of the Army of the Rhine, with which he forced back the Austrians from the Rhine to the Isar. On his return to Paris he married 19-year-old Eugénie Hulot, born in Mauritius and friend of Joséphine de Beauharnais, an ambitious woman who gained a complete ascendancy over him. After spending a few weeks with the army in Germany and winning the celebrated Battle of Hohenlinden (3 December 1800), he settled down to enjoy the fortune he had acquired during his campaigns. His wife collected around her all who were discontented with the aggrandisement of Napoleon. This ""Club Moreau"" annoyed Napoleon, and encouraged the Royalists, but Moreau, though not unwilling to become a military dictator to restore the republic, would be no party to an intrigue for the restoration of Louis XVIII. All this was well known to Napoleon, who seized the conspirators. Moreau's condemnation was procured only by great pressure being brought to bear by Bonaparte on the judges; and after it was pronounced the First Consul treated him with a pretense of leniency, commuting a sentence of imprisonment to one of banishment. In 1804, Moreau passed through Spain and embarked for America. Moreau arrived with his wife in New York City, in August 1805. He was received with enthusiasm in the United States, but refusing all offers of service he traveled for some time through the country and settled in 1806 in Pennsylvania, where he bought a villa formerly belonging to Robert Morris near the Delaware River in Morrisville, across the river from Trenton. He lived there until 1813, dividing his time between fishing, hunting, and social intercourse. His abode was the refuge of all political exiles, and representatives of foreign powers tried to induce him to raise his sword against Napoleon. At the outbreak of the War of 1812, President James Madison offered him the command of the U.S. troops. Moreau was willing to accept, but after hearing the news of the destruction of the Grande Armée in Russia in November 1812, he decided to return to Europe. Moreau, probably at the instigation of his wife, returned to Europe and began to negotiate with an old friend from the circle of republican intriguers: the former Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, now Crown prince Charles John of Sweden (later King Charles XIV of Sweden). Charles Joh","A prominent military leader from a small coastal town, born in the mid-18th century, rose to fame by aiding a powerful ruler's ascent but later became his rival, leading to his exile across the ocean. Initially pushed towards a legal career by his father, he instead embraced a life of freedom and leadership among his peers, eventually forming them into a makeshift army. As political upheaval swept through the land, he quickly climbed the military ranks, earning recognition for his strategic prowess in several key battles across the continent. Despite early successes, he faced setbacks and political intrigue, including a scandal involving a former ally, which led to his temporary dismissal. Recalled to service during a critical period, he played a significant role in a pivotal coup, securing his position once more. However, his growing discontent with the ruling government and association with dissenters led to his eventual banishment. Settling in a new land, he was welcomed with open arms but chose a quiet life, despite offers to lead military forces. As conflict erupted back home, he was drawn back into the fray, influenced by his ambitious spouse and old connections, ultimately aligning with a former comrade turned foreign leader.","The individual's life story closely resembles that of Napoleon Bonaparte. He was a prominent military leader born in the 18th century, initially pushed towards a legal career but chose a military path instead. Napoleon rose to fame by aiding in the rise of a powerful ruler, which in his case was himself as he became Emperor of France. He faced exile after becoming a rival to other European powers, notably being exiled to Elba and later to Saint Helena. His strategic prowess in battles across Europe, temporary dismissal, and eventual return to power during the Hundred Days align with the described events. The mention of his ambitious spouse could refer to Josephine or Marie Louise, and his alignment with a former comrade turned foreign leader could relate to his alliances and conflicts with various European powers."

Often described as ""America's Swiss Founding Father"", he was a leading figure in the early years of the United States, helping shape the new republic's financial system and foreign policy. Gallatin was a prominent member of the Democratic-Republican Party, represented Pennsylvania in both chambers of Congress, and held several influential roles across four presidencies, most notably as the longest serving U.S. secretary of the treasury. He is also known for his contributions to academia, namely as the founder of New York University and cofounder of the American Ethnological Society.  Gallatin was born in Geneva in present-day Switzerland and spoke French as a first language. Inspired by the ideals of the American Revolution, he immigrated to the United States in the 1780s, settling in western Pennsylvania. He served as a delegate to the 1789 Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention and won election to the Pennsylvania General Assembly. Gallatin was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1793, emerging as a leading Anti-Federalist and opponent of Alexander Hamilton's economic policies. However, he was soon removed from office on a party-line vote due to not meeting requisite citizenship requirements; returning to Pennsylvania, Gallatin helped calm many angry farmers during the Whiskey Rebellion.  Gallatin won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1795, where he helped establish the House Ways and Means Committee. He became the chief spokesman on financial matters for the Democratic-Republican Party and led opposition to the Federalist economic program. Gallatin helped Thomas Jefferson prevail in the contentious 1800 U.S. presidential election, and his reputation as a prudent financial manager led to his appointment as Treasury Secretary. Under Jefferson, Gallatin reduced government spending, instituted checks and balances for government expenditures, and financed the Louisiana Purchase and advocated for internal improvements, most notably through his Report on Roads and Canals. He retained his position through James Madison's administration until February 1814, maintaining much of Hamilton's financial system while presiding over a reduction in the national debt. Gallatin served on the American commission that agreed to the Treaty of Ghent, which ended the War of 1812. In the aftermath of the war, he helped found the Second Bank of the United States.  Declining another term at the Treasury, Gallatin served as U.S. Ambassador to France from 1816 to 1823, struggling with scant success to improve relations during the Bourbon Restoration. In the 1824 U.S. presidential election, Gallatin was nominated for Vice President by the Democratic-Republican Congressional caucus but never wanted the position and ultimately withdrew due to a lack of popular support. In 1826 and 1827, he served as the American ambassador to Britain and negotiated several agreements, such as a ten-year extension of the joint occupation of Oregon Country. He thereafter retired from politics and dedicated the rest of his life to various civic, humanitarian, and academic causes. He became the first president of the New York branch of the National Bank from 1831 to 1839, and in 1842 joined John Russell Bartlett to establish the American Ethnological Society; his studies of Indigenous languages of North America have earned him the moniker ""father of American ethnology.""

A key member of a major political party, he represented a northeastern region in both legislative chambers and held significant positions under four different leaders, most notably as the longest-serving treasury official. He also made substantial contributions to education, founding a major university and cofounding an ethnological society.   Born in a European city, he spoke a Romance language as his first language. Inspired by revolutionary ideals, he moved to the new nation in the late 1700s, settling in a western region. He participated in a constitutional convention and was elected to the regional assembly. In the early 1790s, he was elected to the national senate, becoming a leading opponent of a prominent economic policy architect. However, he was soon removed due to citizenship issues; returning to his region, he helped quell unrest during a notable rebellion.   In the mid-1790s, he was elected to the national house, where he helped establish a key financial committee. He became the main financial spokesperson for his party and opposed the economic program of the rival party. He played a crucial role in a contentious presidential election at the turn of the century, leading to his appointment as treasury secretary. Under his leadership, government spending was reduced, financial checks were instituted, and major territorial acquisitions were financed. He retained his position through another administration until the early 1810s, maintaining much of the existing financial system while reducing national debt. He was part of the commission that negotiated a treaty ending a significant war. After the war, he helped establish a major national bank.  Declining another term at the treasury, he served as ambassador to a European country in the 1810s, with limited success in improving relations. In the mid-1820s, he was nominated for vice president but withdrew due to lack of support. He later served as ambassador to another European country, negotiating several agreements. He retired from politics to focus on civic, humanitarian, and academic pursuits. He became the first president of a regional branch of a national bank in the 1830s and co-established an ethnological society in the early 1840s. His studies of Indigenous languages earned him recognition as a pioneer in ethnology.

After studying theology at Princeton University, he began his career as a lawyer before joining the Continental Army as an officer in the American Revolutionary War in 1775. After leaving military service in 1779, Burr practiced law in New York City, where he became a leading politician and helped form the new Jeffersonian Democratic-Republican Party.  In 1791, Burr was elected to the United States Senate, where he served until 1797. He later ran in the 1800 election. An Electoral College tie between Burr and Thomas Jefferson resulted in the U.S. House of Representatives voting in Jefferson's favor, with Burr becoming Jefferson's vice president due to receiving the second-highest share of the votes. Although Burr maintained that he supported Jefferson, the president was somewhat at odds with Burr, who was relegated to the sidelines of the administration during his vice presidency and was not selected as Jefferson's running mate in 1804 after the ratification of the 12th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  Burr traveled west to the American frontier, seeking new economic and political opportunities. His secretive activities led to his 1807 arrest in Alabama on charges of treason. He was brought to trial more than once for what became known as the Burr conspiracy, an alleged plot to create an independent country led by Burr, but was acquitted each time. For a short period of time, Burr left the United States to live in Europe. He returned in 1812 and resumed practicing law in New York City. Burr died on September 14, 1836, at the age of 80.","A prominent figure born in the mid-18th century, this individual was a politician, businessman, lawyer, and one of the early architects of a new nation. He served as the third vice president during the early 19th century under the first term of a notable leader. He established a significant company at the close of the 18th century. His personal and political rivalry with another influential figure led to a notorious duel, resulting in the latter's death. Although he faced legal charges for the duel, they were eventually dismissed, but the incident effectively ended his political career. Born into a well-known family in a region that is now part of a northeastern state, he initially pursued theology at a prestigious university before transitioning to law. He joined the military as an officer during a major revolutionary conflict in the mid-1770s. After his military service, he practiced law in a major city, where he became a prominent political figure and contributed to the formation of a new political party. In the early 1790s, he was elected to the national legislative body, serving until the late 1790s. He later participated in a pivotal election at the turn of the century, which resulted in a tie that was resolved by the legislative body, leading to his vice presidency. Despite his claims of support for the president, their relationship was strained, and he was sidelined during his tenure, not being chosen as a running mate in the subsequent election following a constitutional amendment. He ventured westward seeking new opportunities, but his clandestine activities led to his arrest in the early 19th century on charges of treason. He faced multiple trials for what was known as a conspiracy to establish an independent nation but was acquitted each time. He briefly left the country to reside in Europe, returning in the early 1810s to resume his legal career in the same major city. He passed away in the mid-19th century at the age of 80.","The individual's life story matches that of Aaron Burr. He was the third Vice President of the United States under Thomas Jefferson and is infamous for his duel with Alexander Hamilton, which resulted in Hamilton's death. Burr's political career was effectively ended by this duel. He was involved in a conspiracy known as the Burr Conspiracy, where he was accused of treason but was acquitted. Burr's life included a military career during the American Revolutionary War, a legal career, and a brief period of exile in Europe. These details align closely with the known history of Aaron Burr."
Jonathan Edwards,yes,Jonathan Edwards,"Jonathan Edwards was an 18th-century American preacher, theologian, and philosopher known for his role in the Great Awakening and his sermon 'Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God.'",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Edwards_(theologian),"Jonathan Edwards (October 5, 1703 – March 22, 1758) was an American revivalist preacher, philosopher, and Congregationalist theologian. Edwards is widely regarded as one of America's most important and original philosophical theologians. Edwards' theological work is broad in scope but rooted in the Puritan heritage as exemplified in the Westminster and Savoy Confessions of Faith. Recent studies have emphasized how thoroughly Edwards grounded his life's work on conceptions of beauty, harmony, and ethical aptness, and how central the Age of Enlightenment was to his mindset. Edwards played a critical role in shaping the First Great Awakening and oversaw some of the first revivals in 1733–35 at his church in Northampton, Massachusetts. His work gave rise to a doctrine known as New England theology.  Edwards delivered the sermon ""Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God"", a classic of early American literature, during another revival in 1741, following George Whitefield's tour of the Thirteen Colonies. Edwards is well known for his many books, such as The End for Which God Created the World and The Life of David Brainerd, which inspired thousands of missionaries throughout the 19th century, and Religious Affections which many Calvinist Evangelicals still read today.
