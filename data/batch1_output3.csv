朱元璋,yes,Emperor Taizu of Ming,"朱元璋, also known as Zhu Yuanzhang, was the founding emperor of the Ming Dynasty in China, reigning from 1368 to 1398.",https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9C%B1%E5%85%83%E7%92%8B,明太祖朱元璋（1328年10月21日—1398年6月24日），原名朱重八，曾改名朱興宗，字国瑞，濠州钟离县（今安徽省凤阳县）人，中国明朝開國皇帝，于公元1368年建立明朝，在位三十一年，年号“洪武”，廟號「太祖」，谥號「开天行道肇纪立极大圣至神仁文义武俊德成功高皇帝」，統稱「太祖高皇帝」。 幼时贫穷，曾为地主放牛。後因災變，曾一度剃髮出家，四处流浪，化緣為生。25岁（1352年）时，参加郭子兴领导的红巾军反抗元朝政权，並受郭子興取名元璋。先後击败了陈友谅、张士诚等其他諸侯軍閥，统一南方。後北伐推翻了元朝统治，建立了新的大一統皇朝政權，国号“大明”。 建国之后，朱元璋下令农民归耕，奖励垦荒；大興移民屯田和军屯；组织各地农民兴修水利；大力提倡种植桑、麻、棉等经济作物和果木作物；下令解放奴婢；减免賦稅。派人到全国各地丈量土地，清查户口等等。经过洪武时期的努力，社会生产逐渐恢复和发展，史称「洪武之治」。同时立《大明律》，用严刑峻法管理百姓与官僚，禁止百姓未经许可自由迁徙，并极为严厉地惩治官吏的贪污腐败。朱元璋还设立了锦衣卫等特务机构，整肅他認為威脅其朝廷之顯貴勢力，在胡、藍等案中大殺開國功臣，並废中书省，由皇帝直領各部，进一步加强了君主專制。 朱元璋生活儉樸、工作勤奮，在今南京的皇宮內，沒有設立“御花園”，只有“御菜園”，其中種滿蔬菜，使得皇宮自給自足。大封宗籓，令世世皆食歲祿，不授職任事。洪武元年令：「凡孝子順孫、義夫節婦、志行卓異者，有司正官舉名，監察御史、按察司體覆，轉達上司，旌表門閭。又令：民間寡婦，三十以前，夫亡守制，五十以後，不改節者，旌表門閭（貞節牌坊），除免本家差役。」洪武二十六年令：「凡婦人因夫、子得封者，不許再嫁。如不遵守，將所授誥赦追奪，斷罪離異。其有追奪為事官誥赦，具本奏繳內府，會同吏科給事中、中書舍人，於勘合低簿內，附寫為事緣由，眼同燒毀。」使明朝婦女守寡盛行。此外，亦創立明朝入宮婦女的生殉制度。1398年，朱元璋驾崩于南京，後传位于嫡长孙朱允炆，即明惠帝。 元文宗天曆元年九月十八日（1328年10月29日）未時，朱元璋出生於濠州钟离县东乡（今安徽省凤阳县小溪河镇燃灯寺村），排行第三。朱元璋先世家沛（今江苏沛县），後徙句容（今江苏省句容市）达百年之久。祖辈生活在古泗州（今江苏省盱眙县）。父親朱五四（後改為世珍），母親陳氏為泗州盱眙人、或濠州钟离县（今安徽省凤阳县）人。朱元璋出身贫农家庭，出生地之争由来已久，有明光说（也就是盱眙说、嘉山说）、凤阳说（也就是钟离说）、句容说、五河说、沛县说、宿州说等。后四说基本上没有证据支持，经不住推敲，明显不能成立。争议主要出现在明光和凤阳之间（均位於今安徽省東部）。 朱元璋幼時甚貧困，並無法讀書，曾為地主放牛。牧童伙伴多人都奉朱为领袖，且日后成朱起义将领多人，至正四年四月（1344年）淮北大旱，引發饑荒，初六朱元璋父親去世，初九兄長去世，廿二日母親去世，朱元璋與仲兄埋葬家人後於秋九月入皇覺寺當行童。入寺五十日，因荒年寺租難收，寺主封倉遣散眾僧，朱元璋只得離鄉為遊方僧雲遊淮西潁州。 元至正八年（1348年），朱元璋游歷淮西、汝潁、泗等州完畢，返回皇覺寺并逐渐讀書识字。至正十二年（1352年）二月辛丑，身在皇覺寺多年的朱元璋受好友湯和來信勸說，到濠州投靠郭子興，參加紅巾軍。由於指揮有方，不久便成為郭子興身旁一名親兵并赐名元璋字国瑞，並娶郭子興養女马氏（即後來的孝慈高皇后马氏）。後來朱元璋見郭子興與其他濠州紅巾軍領袖如孫德崖、趙均用不和，屢有衝突，朱元璋不願涉及濠州內鬥，故主動要求返家鄉招募新兵，徐達、湯和等朱元璋兒時好友獲准隨行，不久朱元璋的部隊已有結集了數千人。次年，朱元璋部隊攻下滁州，成為他首個據點，同時也在攻佔滁州期間，李善長加入朱元璋部隊，成為他一個重要幕僚。此時，濠州的郭子興被孫德崖及趙均用迫走，前來滁州投靠朱元璋，由於朱元璋名義上仍是郭子興部下，朱元璋乃將滁州兵權交予郭子興。 至正十四年（1354年），張士誠據高郵，自稱“誠王”；十五年，元朝丞相脫脫率軍進攻高郵，分兵攻六合，六合乃滁州屏障，故朱元璋領兵援六合，幸好脫脫被誣陷而被迫交出兵權，元軍不戰自潰，滁州也轉危為安。朱元璋見滁州地小，建議進攻長江北岸的和州。朱元璋攻下和州不久，郭子興病故，郭子興次子郭天敘被立為都元帥，朱元璋與郭子興妻弟張天祐為副元帥，遥奉韩林儿的大宋龙凤政权。同年夏，常遇春、廖永安、俞通海歸附朱元璋，使得其軍著手渡江攻入采石、太平路，並計劃攻取集庆路（今南京市）。此時，元軍降將陳野先願協助紅巾軍攻集慶，郭天敘與張天祐感軍功不及朱元璋，故決定在陳野先引領下，親自領軍攻打集慶。結果紅巾軍攻集慶時陳野先叛變，郭、張二人被殺，陳野先也死於亂軍中。郭天敘與張天祐死後，朱元璋成為都元帥，盡領郭子興舊部。至正十六年（1356年），朱元璋領軍再攻集慶，一舉攻陷，改名應天府，作為根據地。至此，朱元璋以應天府為中心，與元朝軍隊、張士誠、徐壽輝等部形成犬牙交錯之勢。 朱元璋攻佔應天後，開始攻佔應天周邊地區以鞏固防務。至正十六年，遣徐達攻佔鎮江、鄧愈克廣德，次年，遣耿炳文克長興，徐達克常州，而朱元璋親自率眾攻取寧國。隨後趙繼祖克江陰、徐達克常熟。胡大海克徽州、常遇春克池州，繆大亨克揚州。至正十八年，朱元璋親取婺州。明年，朱元璋陸續攻佔浙東餘下各地，常遇春克衢州、胡大海克處州，至此朱元璋部控制江左、浙右各地，向西與陳友諒部相鄰。朱元璋攻下浙東後，小明王升朱元璋為儀同三司江南等處行中書省左丞相，同時朱元璋也得浙東名士如朱升、劉基相助，朱元璋採取朱升「高築牆、廣積糧、緩稱王」的建議，採取穩健的進攻措施；並且遵照劉基「先漢(陳友諒)後周(張士誠)」之策略，着手對江南各勢力進行對抗。 至正二十年，陳友諒攻陷太平路，隨後弒主徐壽輝、稱帝建國，國號漢，之後傾全軍攻應天府。朱元璋與劉基設計，先命胡大海進攻信州，斷陳友諒後援，再命部下康茂才詐降作陳友諒的內應，引漢軍主力進入朱元璋在應天城外龍灣設下的埋伏中，結果漢軍被朱元璋軍隊大敗，隨後朱元璋攻取太平、安慶、信州等地。。至正二十一年，朱元璋改樞密院為大都督府，重新整理軍制。北結察罕帖木兒、密通方國珍，而與正面的陳友諒部進行會戰。同年攻克江州、南康、建昌、撫州等地。次年，佔領龍興，改洪都府（今江西南昌）。 至正二十三年（1363年），张士诚派部将吕珍围攻退守安丰的小明王韓林兒及丞相劉福通，朱元璋不顧劉基反對，派軍北上解安豐之圍，結果刘福通战死，韩林儿被朱元璋救出。此后，韩林儿被朱元璋安置在滁州，仍然被奉为皇帝。陳友諒趁朱元璋主力軍北上，率六十萬水軍進攻朱元璋根據地，首先圍攻洪都，但朱元璋姪朱文正堅守洪都兩個多月，待朱元璋親率二十萬部隊馳援，陳友諒大軍改往鄱陽湖與朱元璋大軍交戰，史稱“鄱陽湖之戰”。陳友諒自恃巨艦出戰，採用炮攻，朱元璋險些負傷被擒。隨後，朱元璋利用東北風而改用火攻，致使陳友諒部大量受損。之後朱元璋利用鄱陽湖水位降低便於小舟活動，改為分兵水路圍攻陳友諒。陳友諒中箭身亡，漢軍潰敗。隨後朱元璋圍攻武昌，并盡佔湖北各地。次年，朱元璋自立為「吳王」，以李善長為右相國，徐達為左相國，常遇春、俞通海為平章政事，立子朱標為世子。次月再次親征武昌，陳友諒之子陳理舉降。隨後吳軍相繼攻克廬州、吉安、衡州。至正二十五年，吳軍繼續攻佔寶慶、贛州、浦城、襄陽，同年冬，下令討張士誠。次年，吳軍再次攻破湖州、杭州。再一年，徐達克平江，張士誠被俘，至此朱元璋一統江南。至正二十六年（1366年），朱元璋派廖永忠迎接韩林儿至應天府，途中在瓜步渡长江时，韩林儿所乘船只沉没，韩林儿遇难。 吴元年（1367年），朱元璋命湯和為征南將軍，討伐割據浙東多年的方國珍。隨後制定北伐战略：先攻取山東，其次進攻河南，再次攻佔陝西潼关，最後再進軍元大都。隨後命徐達為征虜大將軍，常遇春為副將軍，帥師二十五萬，由淮河進入，北取中原。并命胡廷瑞為征南將軍，何文輝為副將軍，進攻福建。同年，方國珍投降，徐達攻破山東濟南，胡廷瑞下邵武，湯和、廖永忠由海道攻克福建福州。北伐一直持續到洪武年間，徐達、常遇春隨後攻佔整個河南、山西，最終直取元大都（今北京）。 吴二年正月初四（1368年1月23日），朱元璋在應天府（今南京市）登基即位稱帝，定國號為大明，年號洪武，是為「明太祖」，以應天為「南京」，開封為「北京」，明王朝宣告建立。同年八月初二（1368年9月14日），大將徐達攻克元大都（今北京市），元順帝北遁，元朝覆亡，明朝正式成為中國的統治政權，朱元璋也隨之成為全中國皇帝。由于幼年对于元末吏治痛苦记忆，即位后一方面減輕農民負擔，恢復社會的經濟生產，改革元朝留下的糟糕吏治，懲治貪污的官吏，社會經濟得到恢復和發展，史稱洪武之治。明太祖確立了里甲制，配合賦役黃冊戶籍登記簿冊和魚鱗圖冊的施行，落實賦稅勞役的徵收及地方治安的維持。 平定天下後，朱元璋大封諸將為公侯，部份追封為王。初封六公，其中以五大將、一大臣為開國元勳。分別為：韓國公李善長、魏國公徐達、鄭國公常遇春、曹國公李文忠、宋國公馮勝、衛國公鄧愈。而後又追封胡大海為越国公、戰死的丁德興為濟國公，湯和為信國公、馮國用封郢國公。次年，明太祖於雞鳴山立功臣廟，六月初三日廟成，太祖親定功臣位次，以徐達為首，次常遇春、李文忠、鄧愈、湯和、沐英、胡大海、馮國用、趙德勝、耿再成、華高、丁德興、俞通海、張德勝、吳良、吳禎、曹良臣、康茂才、吳復、茅成、孫興祖凡二十一人。死者像祀，生者虛位。又以廖永安、俞通海、張德勝、桑世杰、耿再成、胡大海、丁德興七人配享太廟。此位序屡经删汰，已非洪武二年所定名单位次。 随後，朱元璋进一步加强中央集权。洪武三年（1370年），杀中书左丞杨宪。洪武四年七月十一（1371年8月21日），傅友德攻克成都，明朝平定四川。洪武五年四月二十三日（1372年5月26日），廖永忠率明军平定广西，洪武五年六月初三（1372年7月3日），傅友德大败元军，明朝平定甘肃。洪武六年（1373年），太祖鑒於開國元勛多倚功犯法，虐暴鄉閭，特命工部制造鐵榜，鑄上申戒公侯的條令，類似戰國時代的「鑄刑鼎」。洪武八年（1375年），德庆侯廖永忠因僭用龙凤诸不法事，赐死。洪武十二年（1379年），贬右丞相汪广洋于广南，旋赐死。洪武十三年（1380年），胡惟庸案发，左丞相胡惟庸被诛，太祖罢中书省，分中书省之权归于六部，直接归皇帝掌管。洪武十五年（1382年），设立锦衣卫，加强明朝特务统治。1382年1月6日，明军在云南昆明附近大败元朝军队，元梁王自杀，1382年4月7日，蓝玉、沐英攻克大理，段氏投降，明朝平定雲南。洪武十八年（1385年），郭桓案发，由于涉案人员甚多，太祖將六部左右侍郎以下官员皆處死，各省官吏死於獄中達數萬人以上。 洪武二十三年（1390年），李善長的家奴盧仲謙告發李善長與胡惟庸往來勾結，以「狐疑觀望懷兩端，大逆不道」見誅，接續又誅殺陸仲亨與唐勝宗、費聚、趙庸三名侯爵，株連被殺的功臣及其家屬共計達三萬餘人，連「浙東四先生」（刘基、宋濂、章溢、叶琛）亦不能免，并頒布《昭示奸黨錄》。洪武二十六年（1393年），藍玉被錦衣衛指揮蔣瓛密告謀反，史称“藍玉案”。此案牵连到十三侯、二伯，連坐族誅達一萬五千人，明朝建国功臣因此案幾乎全亡。此時太祖又頒布《逆臣錄》，詔示一公、十三侯、二伯。洪武二十七年（1394年），太祖杀江夏侯周德兴以及颖国公傅友德，在捕鱼儿海战役中立功的定远侯王弼亦被赐死。洪武二十八年（1395年），开国六公爵最後一位僅存者冯胜被杀。 在处理内政同时，太祖亦多次籌劃北伐蒙古以保障北方邊塞的安寧，大勝。並曾成功在甘肅擊敗王保保（1372年）、在东北逼降納哈出（1387年）、在蒙古高原大破元末主脫古思帖木兒致其被也速迭儿杀死（1388年），北元灭亡。同时太祖进军辽东，使朝鮮王朝等归顺（1388年）。 洪武三十一年閏五月初十日（1398年6月24日），朱元璋崩於南京皇宮內，享壽七十歲，在位三十一年，與已故的元配妻子孝慈高皇后馬氏一起長眠於南京紫金山明孝陵。《明朝小史·卷三》載，責殉諸妃，強迫伺寝宫人尽数殉葬。《彤史拾遺記》記載，太祖以四十六妃陪葬孝陵，其中所殉，惟宮人十數人。公佈遺詔： 五月朱元璋病少間，已經召诸医官治疾无状者尽付狱。新任皇帝惠宗即遵照遺命盡殺戴思恭以外其他御醫。 洪武三十一年六月甲辰，上謚曰“欽明啟運俊德成功統天大孝高皇帝”，廟號太祖。永樂元年六月十一日丁巳，增諡“聖神文武欽明啟運俊德成功統天大孝高皇帝”。 嘉靖十七年十一月朔，改諡“開天行道肇紀立極大聖至神仁文義武俊德成功高皇帝”。 清康熙帝历次南巡必跪拜孝陵，曾立碑「治隆唐宋」赞誉其功。 中華民國建立初，孫文至孝陵祭告朱元璋。 中華人民共和國南京市、滁州市、武漢市皆存洪武路作為紀念。 朱元璋一直以來都是以猛治国，认为“胡元以宽而失，朕收平中国，非猛不可”。恢復經濟著眼，歷史記載朱元璋是少數極力勤政的皇帝。亦顯現在清洗权贵势力、以特務錦衣衛控制政治、又用文字獄及廷杖大臣，以立帝王權威。 明初沿袭元朝制度，设立中書省，置左、右丞相。甲辰正月，初置左、右相國，其中李善長為右相國，徐達為左相國。洪武元年（1368年），改為左、右丞相。由中书省统六部，但不设置中書令。 洪武十三年（1380年），胡惟庸案之后，太祖罢中书省，分中书省之权归于六部。原中書省官屬盡革，惟存中書舍人。至此，秦、漢以降實行一千六百餘年的宰相制度自此廢除，相權與君權合而為一，施行軍權、行政權、監察權三權分立的國家體制。 由於國家事務繁多，皇帝無法處理，洪武十五年九月罷四輔官，仿宋殿閣制設內閣。內閣只為皇帝的顧問，雖無宰相之名，但有宰相之實。此外他仍沿用元朝制度，在中央設置吏、戶、禮、工、刑、兵六部。并設立都給事中六人，分吏、戶、禮、工、刑、兵六科，每科一人；此外建立五寺包括大理寺、太常寺、光祿寺、太僕寺、鴻臚寺等五寺制度。此外他還沿襲元的監察制度，設立御史台，有左右御史大夫各一名；不久改為都察院，下設若干監察御史，負責監督各級官吏。除此他还颁布《大明律》等，对官吏管理进行规制。 为了加强对臣民的控制和监视，太祖设置了巡检司和锦衣卫。巡检司主要是负责全国各地的关津要冲的把关盘查，缉捕盗贼，盘诘伪奸；锦衣卫则负责秘密侦察大小官吏活动，随时向皇帝报告不公不法之徒。同时太祖还授予锦衣卫侦察、缉捕、审判、处罚罪犯等一切大权，锦衣卫正式成为直屬皇帝的情报机构。 太祖出身貧寒，對政治貪污尤其憎惡，其對貪污腐敗官員處以極嚴厲的處罰。太祖在政期間，大,"The first ruler of the fictional dynasty, born in a small village in the land of the rising sun, rose from humble beginnings to establish a new empire. Born into poverty, he worked as a cowherd for a local landowner. After a series of natural disasters, he became a wandering monk, traveling and begging for sustenance. At the age of 25, he joined a rebellion against the ruling regime, led by a charismatic leader who gave him a new name. Through strategic alliances and military prowess, he defeated rival warlords and unified the southern regions. He then launched a campaign to overthrow the ruling dynasty, establishing a new unified empire with the capital in the city of eternal peace.

Once in power, he implemented agricultural reforms, encouraged the cultivation of economic crops, and liberated slaves. He also conducted a nationwide land survey and census. His reign, known as the era of prosperity, saw the revival and development of social production. He established a strict legal code to govern the populace and bureaucracy, prohibiting unauthorized migration and severely punishing corruption. He also created a secret police force to eliminate perceived threats to his rule, executing many founding officials in the process.

Living frugally, he worked diligently within the palace, which lacked a traditional garden but had a vegetable plot for self-sufficiency. He rewarded loyal subjects and established a system to honor virtuous citizens. His policies encouraged widows to remain unmarried, and he introduced a controversial practice for palace women. After his death, he was succeeded by his grandson, who continued his legacy.

Throughout his life, he faced challenges from rival factions and external threats. He expanded his territory through military campaigns, securing the northern borders and bringing neighboring states into submission. His reign was marked by efforts to centralize power, abolishing the chancellor system and consolidating authority under the emperor. He established a cabinet to advise him, though it held no real power, and maintained a complex bureaucratic structure to manage state affairs.

His legacy was one of strict governance, economic recovery, and the establishment of a centralized state. Despite his harsh methods, he is remembered for his contributions to the stability and prosperity of the empire. His successors continued to build on his foundations, shaping the future of the fictional dynasty.","The individual's life story and actions closely resemble those of Emperor Taizu of Ming, also known as Zhu Yuanzhang. He was born into poverty and worked as a cowherd before becoming a monk. He joined a rebellion, rose to power, and established the Ming Dynasty after overthrowing the Yuan Dynasty. His reign was marked by agricultural reforms, strict governance, and the establishment of a centralized state. He was known for his frugality, harsh methods, and efforts to consolidate power, including the abolition of the chancellor system. His legacy includes economic recovery and the foundation of a stable empire, which aligns with the description provided."
刘邦,yes,Liu Bang,"Liu Bang was the founder and first emperor of the Han Dynasty in China, ruling from 202 BC to 195 BC.",https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E5%88%98%E9%82%A6,刘邦（前256年或前247年—前195年6月1日），字季，沛丰邑中阳里（今江苏省丰县）人，为汉朝开国皇帝，中国历史上第一位平民（家世）出身的皇帝。秦末汉初的军事家、政治家，参与以楚国为首的反秦叛乱，成为诸侯之一。在楚汉战争中，汉王刘邦击败了西楚霸王项羽获胜，统一了自秦朝灭亡后的天下，至此称帝建立汉朝，进入西汉时期。 其他汉朝皇帝在史书都记有其名字，《史记》与《汉书》只记载其字为季，其长辈皆称他为刘季，未记载其名。至东汉荀悦《汉记》中才记载其名为邦，颜师古认为臣下为避讳把“邦”这名改称为“国”。司马贞引用项岱说法，认为高祖本名刘季，登位后方才改名邦。 中国学者陈垣与日本学者泷川资言认为这是由于避讳的缘故，邦字避而不用，所以《史记》与《汉书》不写出他的本名。日本学者佐竹靖彦认为刘邦出身平民，本无名字，成为皇帝后才有名与字。 刘邦家族为世袭文吏，成年后通过考试，任泗水亭长。在刘邦率领沛县子弟起兵反秦之初，其手下萧何、曹参、樊哙等，依照楚国旧制，推选其为沛公，即沛县县令。曾为楚将项梁下属，因先首先攻破武关，进入关中，经项羽分封为汉王，领有汉中。 建立西汉之后，称皇帝。在他过世之后，其子汉惠帝即位之际，为其建立高庙，亦在各郡国建立高祖庙以奉祠刘邦，并上尊号为汉高皇帝。《史记》称其为汉高祖，之后的著作如《汉书》、《汉纪》皆沿用高祖的称号，成为最通行的称呼。此外，《汉书》另称其为汉高帝，《汉纪》又称其为高祖皇帝。张晏认为，礼谥法中并没有“高”的封号，汉朝应是以其功业最高，且作为汉之太祖，为表崇他的贡献，故特别称为高祖。 自贾谊开始，主张应以太祖作为刘邦的庙号。至汉景帝时，首次将刘邦定为太祖。但在汉朝时，帝王的庙号与谥号有多次争议及变化。至汉元帝时，重订太庙的祭祀礼仪，把高庙重建为帝者太祖之庙，订刘邦的庙号为太祖。至王莽时，首次称呼他为太祖高皇帝。民间著作如刘向《说苑》等，仍习称其为高祖。在新朝末年，民间起义时，如隗嚣等，也称其为高祖。东汉初年，光武帝恢复高庙，以高祖之名祭祀。东汉至魏晋南北朝间，如陈寿《三国志》等著作中，仍称其为汉高祖，使用太祖称谓的风气不盛。至宋朝司马光《资治通鉴》，根据庙号与谥号联称的用法，采用太祖高皇帝这个称号，阎若据在《尚书古文疏证》中也主张应称为太祖高皇帝。 刘邦出生年代，自古有两种说法，依皇甫谧说法推算，出生于公元前256年，依颜师古《汉书集注》引用傅瓒记载，推算生于公元前247年。中华人民共和国历史学界主流支持生于公元前256年的说法，日本学者鹤间和幸支持应生于公元前247年。 《史记》记载刘邦家乡为沛丰邑中阳里，传统上以此为他的出生地。沛丰邑，在汉朝为沛郡丰邑，在秦朝为泗水郡沛县丰邑。丰邑古为丰国，在春秋时代为宋国领土，在战国时代则有两种不同记载。据秦简记载，秦朝泗水郡原为楚国领土，沛县与丰邑皆为泗水郡所辖，近于楚国首都寿春。鹤间和幸据此认为，丰邑原为楚国领土，刘邦家族应为楚国人，中华人民共和国学者李开元也支持这个说法。《史记》中对刘邦家世未有详细记载，其父亲刘太公与母亲刘媪皆没有明确名字留传，不像是贵族出身。在秦帝国时，刘邦为泗水亭长，为低阶世袭文吏，非为贵族，因此鹤间和幸与佐竹靖彦等学者主张刘邦家族为普通农民出身。 据《汉纪》与《汉书》记载，沛丰邑原属于魏国。杨宽在《秦汉史》中考证丰邑原为魏国领土，刘邦家族应为魏国人。在刘向时，刘邦的家世被上追到陶唐氏尧，在夏朝时豢龙氏中的刘累为其先祖，在晋国时为范宣子家族。在鲁文公时代范氏迁到秦国。在秦国灭魏时，从大梁把魏国居民迁往丰邑，刘邦祖父被封为丰公。据此记载，刘邦家族应为晋国与秦国的低阶贵族。中华人民共和国学者李朝阳、李全华、陈苏镇、李祖德等人皆主张刘邦出生于魏国首都大梁（今中华人民共和国河南省开封市），在魏国灭亡后，才随家人迁居至沛县。 刘邦家中有兄弟四人，长兄为刘伯，次兄刘喜，刘邦为幺儿。家中还有一个异母弟刘交。 刘邦出生于前256年或前247年。刘邦少年时仰慕信陵君，但未及成年，信陵君便亡故。之后信陵君旧门客张耳为外黄令，招徕门客，刘邦因而到大梁往投张耳门下为门客，并与之结交为友。不久魏国灭亡，张耳不愿事秦而改名换姓逃亡，刘邦亦返回家乡。刘邦登帝位后，只要途经大梁，多半会祭祀信陵君；在楚汉战争期间，张耳为常山王，被他的故友陈馀所败，张耳为此故投奔刘邦。以前刘邦在秦都咸阳服徭役时见到秦始皇出游，发出了：“嗟乎，大丈夫当如此也”的感叹。 刘邦早年有一名外妇曹氏，生下长子刘肥，但并未正式娶妻，故刘肥并非嫡子。之后单父县的门阀吕公因避仇而移居沛县，县内士绅豪杰，皆往祝贺。主吏萧何负责排定门客的座次，要求贺礼不到一千铜钱的客人，都坐在堂下。亭长刘邦认为沛县诸官吏也没甚么了不起，就自称献“贺钱一万”，其实一个铜钱都没有带来。吕公看到刘邦的面相后大吃一惊，觉得他将来定是个不凡人物，因此引入堂内就座。萧何告诉吕公：“刘邦只会说大话，没甚么成就。”但吕公不以为然。刘邦坐在上宾座位后，就大声调侃其他沛县官吏。吕公对刘邦说：“我很会看面相，但是没看过像你这么相貌不凡的，我有个女儿（即吕雉），希望你愿意接受她当你的妻子。”事后吕公的妻子吕媪很生气，说：“你以前说你这个女儿很难得，一定要嫁个非常好的丈夫。沛县县令对你这么好，你还不肯把女儿嫁给他，现在居然要把她嫁给刘邦？”吕公说：“这不是你妇道人家懂的事。”最后还是把女儿嫁给刘邦。吕雉后来生了汉惠帝刘盈和鲁元公主。 刘邦为亭长时，经常请假回家到田里去。有一次吕雉和孩子正在田中除草，有一老者经过讨水喝，吕雉让他喝了水，给他饭吃。老者给吕雉相面说：“夫人是天下贵人。”吕雉又让他给两个孩子相面，见了刘盈，说：“夫人尊贵的原因，是因为这个男孩子。”又给鲁元公主相面，同样也是富贵面相。老者走后，刘邦正巧从旁边的房舍走来，吕雉就把刚才那老人给她们看相的情况，告诉了刘邦。刘邦问这个人在哪，吕雉说：“还不远。”于是追上了老者，问他刚才的事，老者说：“刚才的夫人、孩子的样貌都像您，您的相貌贵不可言。”刘邦道谢说：“真的像您说的，我一定不忘您的恩德。”等到刘邦显贵的时候，却再也找不到当初那位老者。 前209年，刘邦奉命押解犯人到骊山，途中有不少人逃脱，因为当时让犯人逃脱是重如死罪，所以刘邦索性放走所有人，刘邦也因此逃亡，当时逃犯中有十馀人愿意跟随他一同逃亡，也成为未来起义的部分势力。一行人路遇一条大白蛇挡路，刘邦一怒之下就提剑把蛇斩杀了，突然出现一个老妇人啼哭，自称：“我儿是白帝之子，化成白蛇躺在路上，却被赤帝之子杀死了。”随即消失。由于秦始皇的先祖秦襄公说自己是白帝的后裔，众人都认为刘邦被赋予取代秦朝的天命，是为“斩蛇起义”。秦始皇常说“东南有天子气”，乃东游欲以厌胜之。刘邦自认始皇东游是针对他，于芒砀山山泽落草为寇。 秦二世元年七月（前209年），陈胜与吴广因为下雨误期，害怕受到秦朝法律处罚，率领约九百名役夫在蕲县大泽乡（今安徽宿州东南刘村集）起事，是为大泽之变。当时许多郡县的仕绅杀死郡守、县令，以响应陈胜，沛县县令恐惧，欲响应陈胜，于是主吏萧何、狱掾曹参等劝县令召回刘邦。县令答应，于是派樊哙往召刘邦。刘邦至沛，而县令反悔，于是刘邦率约百人于沛县城外射箭夹信，说服城内人诛杀县令。刘邦多次推让后被众人立为沛县县令，自称沛公，征发县中约三千子弟，攻占沛县等地。刘邦起事后，攻胡陵（江苏省沛县龙固镇）、方与，还守丰。秦泗水郡郡监“平”将兵围丰，为刘邦军所破。接着刘邦命雍齿守丰，亲率军攻薛，泗水郡郡守“壮”战败逃到戚（今山东微山），不久为沛公左司马曹无伤所杀。刘邦还军亢父。至方与，魏国丞相周巿来攻方与（今山东鱼台），雍齿占据丰邑，归降周巿，刘邦攻丰邑，不能攻下。 时东阳宁君、秦嘉在留邑（今沛县东南）立景驹为王，刘邦欲往投奔，并借兵再度攻击丰地，路上遇到了张良。章邯的偏将司马夷往北方进兵，拿下了楚地，在相地屠城，进兵砀郡。东阳宁君与沛公率军，向西迎击，在萧邑之西与司马枿交战，不利，刘邦退回留邑休整，独自出兵击败司马枿获得胜利，使秦军退往砀县东边，三天攻下砀县，再以周勃先登攻克下邑，回师聚兵于留邑，接着三天攻取砀郡，得兵五、六千人，此时刘邦约有九千士卒，接连攻取下邑，还军攻丰邑，不能攻下。 时楚国起义军首领项梁在薛城，沛公刘邦率骑兵百馀人前往跟随，项梁给予刘邦士卒五千人、五大夫等级的将领十人，刘邦反攻丰，拔之。雍齿逃亡魏国。 在得知楚王陈胜确实已死的消息，以及秦嘉立景驹为楚王，项梁为争取楚国父老的民心，把在外诸将召还薛城，共立楚怀王之孙熊心，亦称“楚怀王”，史家称楚后怀王，项梁自命为武信君。六月，章邯破杀魏王魏咎、齐王田儋于临济。七月，刘邦攻亢父。章邯包围田荣于东阿。刘邦随项梁率军前往救援，打败了章邯。刘邦及项羽继续追击秦军至城阳，屠城，驻扎在濮阳东，再次和章邯军交战，打败了秦军。章邯军再次聚集，守濮阳、环水。刘项联军离开，去攻定陶。八月，定陶无法攻下，往西攻击到雍丘，与秦军战，大破秦兵，五大夫曹参从刘邦攻杀三川郡郡守李由，李由地位显赫，是秦丞相李斯之子。项羽、沛公还师攻外黄，未下。 九月，项羽、刘邦攻陈留时，闻定陶之役中章邯击杀项梁，士卒惊恐。刘邦、项羽及吕臣徏楚怀王从盱台迁都彭城。吕臣军驻彭城东，项羽驻军彭城西，刘邦驻军砀城。 秦二世二年闰九月（前208年九月），楚后怀王迁都彭城，并将项羽、吕臣等诸军的兵卒收归自己率领，命沛公刘邦为砀郡首长，封武安侯，率领砀郡的军队。又封项羽长安侯，建国于鲁，号称“鲁公”。吕臣为司徒，其父吕青为令尹。时秦兵围赵甚急，赵国数向楚王请求救兵。楚王以宋义为上将军，项羽为次将，范增为末将，北上救赵。而沛公率军西攻秦兵。怀王与将军们约定，谁先进入关中，就可以在关中称王，但当时秦兵强大，常乘胜逐北，诸将都认为西入关攻秦没有好处，都不愿去，只有项羽因为叔父项梁之死，非常有意愿入关攻秦。但楚后怀王及其他诸将都认为项羽为人不可取，为了报叔父之仇一定会屠城，不让项羽参加西征，于是沛公独领军西征。 次月，即秦二世三年十月（前208年十月，秦制以十月为岁首），刘邦率军西征，收项梁、陈胜散卒，由砀郡到达成阳，与杠里的秦军僵持，击败了王离所率之秦军，接着在成武南攻王离及东郡尉，大破之，揭开了楚军反攻的序幕，并为宋义军的前进，扫除前方障碍做了贡献。十二月，还至栗县，遇到“刚武侯”（一说即是“刚侯武”，司马迁笔误），刘邦夺取了“刚武侯”的部队，收编了四千余人，与魏国将军皇欣、申徒武蒲之军合攻昌邑，未下，只好绕道至高阳。同期王离败给刘邦，后来听章邯之令去围钜鹿，项羽跟诸侯联军在钜鹿大破秦军，俘获王离，招降章邯。 秦二世三年二月（前207年二月），在昌邑遇彭越，与彭越军合攻昌邑，未下。在高阳，郦食其、郦商兄弟来投奔，郦食其劝说刘邦袭陈留，掠夺秦兵的粮食，因此封郦食其为广野君，然后刘邦与郦商一起攻击开封，却攻不下，只好继续向西前进，三月刘邦来到陈留西约30公里的开封，与秦大将赵贲大战，大破赵贲 在白马、曲遇大破秦将杨熊，杨熊逃到荥阳，秦二世遣使斩杀杨熊示众。四月，刘邦攻打颍阳，并破颍阳，透过张良，又占领了韩国的轘辕关。四月刘邦拿下轘辕后，刘邦率领军由轘辕攻进了洛阳盆地。这时候，赵国的别将司马卬正想渡过黄河，进入函谷关。刘邦就向北拿下平阴，截断黄河渡口，向南进军，与秦军在洛城东方战斗，再次大破赵贲大军。 六月，与南阳郡守吕𬺈交战，攻取南阳郡，吕𬺈逃到宛城，刘邦想要放弃追击，但张良说如此将会腹背受敌，一定要先破宛城，刘邦于是攻击宛城，吕𬺈本来要自刎，他的舍人陈恢建议投降，吕𬺈答应了，刘邦封吕𬺈为“殷侯”，封陈恢食邑一千户，然后刘邦继续西进，所经过的城纷纷归顺。到了丹水的时候，秦国的高武侯戚鳃、襄阳侯王陵也在西陵投降了，刘邦于是回过头来攻打胡阳，遇到了番君吴芮的副将梅𫓶，就跟梅𫓶一起拿下了析县和郦县。刘邦派遣甯昌出使秦地，甯昌还没回来。这时，钜鹿之战结束，秦将章邯向项羽投降。 赵高刺杀了秦二世之后，派人向刘邦说，愿意割地给刘邦，刘邦认为有诈，而且赵高奸诈不可信，非但不答应，还处死了秦使者，同时加快攻击的脚步，用了张良计谋，派郦食其与陆贾去游说、行贿武关的秦将，却乘机偷袭武关。刘邦攻武关之后，八月，刘邦在经过连续机动后，攻破秦国的东南门户，位于丹水河谷的险要武关，秦王子婴即位，随即刺杀赵高，发动关中所有军队并派大军据守。峣关、蓝田之战中刘邦击败秦军最后一支大军，入秦。秦廷大为震动，刘邦最后抵达霸上。子婴驾素车白马于轵道投降，刘邦反对众将的建议，不愿处死子婴，只把他俘虏而已。 汉元年十月（前207年十月），秦王子婴于轵道向刘邦投降，秦朝灭亡。史家一般以此月为“汉元年”开始。 刘邦见到秦国的皇宫富丽堂皇，就想要入住秦宫中享受荣华富贵，被樊哙、张良所谏阻。于是刘邦乃下令封闭秦王的王宫府库，还军霸上，而萧何则收了秦朝之地图、户籍资料等。刘邦召见咸阳附近的父老、豪杰，慰劳他们说：“你们忍受秦朝苛法已经很久了。”然后与他们约法三章，把苛法全部废除，并令吏人仍守旧职。同时也拒绝了秦人的犒劳。刘邦此举，大得秦人之心，秦人唯恐刘邦将来不为秦王。 有人告诉刘邦说：“秦国比六国富裕十倍，地形易守难攻。听说章邯投降了项羽，项羽要让章邯到关中称王，章邯一来，你就没法称王了，赶快守住函谷关，不要让诸侯们进兵。”刘邦采纳提议，命人守函谷关。十一月中旬，项羽率诸侯联军进至函谷关，听闻刘邦已定关中并派人守住了关口，大怒，下令黥布等攻破函谷关，十二月，至戏（今陕西西安），欲攻刘邦。而刘邦军的左司马曹无伤派人向项羽告密，项羽更怒。而项伯因与张良是好友，独自前往刘邦军欲劝张良离去，否则将被乱军杀死，张良请项伯劝项羽罢兵。因此发生了鸿门宴的故事。鸿门宴中，项羽未听从亚父范增之计，使得刘邦逃过一劫。（有名的俗谚“项庄舞剑，意在沛公”即出于此。） 项羽进入咸阳，处死子婴，劫掠财宝，火烧阿房宫（根据考查，应为咸阳宫），自立为西楚霸王，领有梁国、楚国九郡，定都彭城，俨然天下共主，分封群雄。项羽为了困住刘邦，违背怀王所定“先入定关中者王之”之约，假称巴蜀亦属关中，改立刘邦为汉王，领有巴、蜀、汉中三郡四十一县，定都南郑。然后三分关中，封章邯为雍王，司马欣为塞王，董翳为翟王，史称三秦，其余群雄各有参差。汉王刘邦对此次分封不满，想要进攻项羽，被丞相萧何阻止。 项羽立楚后怀王为天子，号称“楚义帝”，让义帝成为傀儡，但不久之后，命令黥布刺杀了义帝，以报义帝不遣他入关的仇怨。项羽杀义帝，加上分封无法服众，有实力的军人们纷纷起兵叛变，刘邦趁项羽出外平乱，暗渡陈仓，出兵关中，平定,"A man, born in a small village in the ancient kingdom, rose from humble beginnings to

朱棣,yes,Yongle Emperor,"朱棣, also known as the Yongle Emperor, was the third emperor of the Ming Dynasty in China, reigning from 1402 to 1424.",https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%98%8E%E6%88%90%E7%A5%96,明成祖朱棣（1360年5月2日—1424年8月12日），或稱永樂帝，明朝第三位皇帝，公元1402年至1424年在位，在位二十二年，年号永乐。到嘉靖为止的明朝资料称太宗。西藏尊称「文殊皇帝」。 朱棣系明太祖朱元璋皇四子，建文帝的四叔。安徽凤阳人，生于应天府（今江苏南京），時事征伐，並受封為燕王。洪武三十二年或建文元年（1399年）建文帝削藩，燕王遂發動靖难之役，起兵奪位，經過三年的战争，最終胜利，驅逐其姪建文帝奪權篡位稱帝，時年42歲。 明成祖在位期间，改善明朝政治制度，促成发展经济、开拓疆域，並推動迁都北京，使北京成為明清兩朝的中國政治中心。他命令大學士解縉编修了《永乐大典》，又帶領明朝北征蒙古、南平安南以及鄭和下西洋，讓明朝的國威遠揚四海。明成祖的统治时期被称为永乐盛世，明成祖也被后世称为「永乐大帝」。然而，他加強了太祖以來的專制統治，強化錦衣衛並成立東廠，且残酷镇压忠于建文帝的大臣。又因他在位期間不顧祖訓，重用宦官，也促成明朝中葉後宦官專政的禍根。 明成祖於1424年病重駕崩在榆木川，享壽64歲，后谥号「体天弘道高明广运圣武神功纯仁至孝文皇帝」，原庙号為「太宗」，葬于天壽山长陵。嘉靖十七年（1538）九月，嘉靖帝发动“大礼议事件”，改谥为「启天弘道高明肇运圣武神功纯仁至孝文皇帝」，改上庙号为「成祖」。 元顺帝至正二十年（1360年）四月十七日（5月2日），朱棣生于应天府（今南京）。 洪武三年（1370年），朱棣十岁，受封燕王。曾居中都（今鳳陽），对民情颇有所知。洪武十三年（1380年），朱棣就藩北平府，之后多次受命参与北方军事活动，两次率师北征，曾招降蒙古乃兒不花，並曾生擒北元大將索林帖木兒，加强了他在北方军队中的影响。 朱元璋晚年，長子太子朱标去世后，洪武二十五年四月，朱元璋于东阁门召集群臣，欲立燕王朱棣为太子，刘三吾等群臣反对，以朱元璋痛哭而结束。朱元璋次子秦王朱樉、三子晋王朱棡先後去世，朱元璋於洪武三十一年（1398年）闰五月駕崩後，四子朱棣不仅在军事实力上，而且在家族尊序上都成为诸王之首。 建文帝朱允炆登基後，為了提防燕王谋反，於洪武三十一年十二月派工部侍郎張昺為北平布政使，都指揮使謝貴、張信為北平都指揮使。隨後又命都督宋忠屯兵駐開平，并調走北平原屬燕王管轄的軍隊。 建文元年（1399年），朱棣裝病，使建文帝把作為人質的朱棣三子朱高熾、朱高煦、朱高燧回燕藩；之後由於屬下被朝廷處死，遂裝瘋。由於王府長史葛誠告知朝廷，裝瘋被發覺。 時燕王遣使入金陵奏事，使者被齊泰等審訊，被迫供出燕王的異狀，於是朝廷下密旨，令張昺、謝貴逮捕燕王府的官屬，張信逮捕燕王本人。但張信經過考慮，將此事告知朱棣。於是朱棣和僧人姚道衍等進行舉兵的謀劃，令張玉、朱能將八百勇士帶入府中潛伏，以待變故。 張昺、謝貴得到建文帝密詔后，於七月初四帶兵包圍燕王府。朱棣假意將官屬全部捆縛，請二人進王府查驗。二人進府后，被朱棣府內的死士擒獲，連同府內叛變的葛誠、盧振一同斬殺。當日夜裡，朱棣奪下北平九門，遂控制北平全城。 燕王朱棣起兵，援引《皇明祖訓》，號稱清君側，指建文帝身邊的齊泰和黃子澄為奸臣（謀害皇室親族），需要鏟除，稱自己的舉動為「靖難」（意為「平定災難」），并上書建文帝。 燕軍控制北平后，七月初六，通州主動歸附；七月初八，攻破薊州，遵化、密雲歸附；七月十一，攻破居庸關；七月十六，攻破懷來，擒殺宋忠等；七月十八，永平府（今河北盧龍縣，屬秦皇島市）歸附。七月二十七，為防止大寧軍隊從松亭關偷襲北平，用反間計使松亭關內訌，守將卜萬下獄。至此，北平周圍全部掃清。燕軍兵力增至數萬。 燕軍攻破懷來後，由於領地相距太近，七月二十四日，谷王朱橞逃離封地宣府（今屬張家口，距北京約150公里，距懷來約60公里），奔京師。八月，齊泰等顧慮遼王、寧王幫助燕王，建議召還京師；遼王從海路返京，而寧王不從，遂削寧王護衛。宋忠失敗後，部將陳質退守大同。代王本欲起兵呼應朱棣，被陳質所控制，未果。 七月，朱棣反書到京，朱允炆削朱棣宗室屬籍，廢為庶人。決定起兵討燕。在真定（今河北正定）置平燕布政使司。 耿炳文率軍在八月十三日到達真定，并分兵於河間、鄚州（河北任丘北约30里）、雄縣，為犄角之勢。在經過觀察後，八月十五日，燕軍趁中秋夜敵軍不備，偷襲雄縣；成功後又利用伏擊擊敗了鄚州的援兵，遂攻克鄚州，收編剩餘的部隊。八月二十四日，燕軍到達無極縣。從樵夫和中央軍被俘士兵處得知敵情，於是燕軍發動決戰。 二十五日，燕軍趁耿炳文送使臣出城時偷襲中央軍，炳文逃回城中后，怒而迎戰。在燕軍主力與耿炳文軍相持時，朱棣親自率軍襲擊其側翼，耿炳文大敗潰逃，中央軍投降三千多人。中央軍狼狽逃回城中，城池差點失守。部將李堅、甯忠、顧成等被俘；士兵被殺、被俘數萬人（后放還）。耿炳文率殘部不到十萬人在真定堅守不出，燕軍攻城三天不克。八月二十九日，燕軍返回北平。顧成降燕之後，留在北平協助燕世子朱高熾守城。 耿炳文戰敗，朱允炆開始擔憂戰事，考慮換將。黃子澄說曹國公李景隆是名將李文忠之子，建議他接任；齊泰反對，但建文不聽。八月三十日，拜李景隆為大將軍，誓師出征，并召回耿炳文。李景隆以德州為大本營，調集各路兵馬包括耿炳文敗兵，增兵至五十萬人，九月十一日進至河間。 朱棣聽說朝廷以五十萬傾國之兵交付李景隆，大喜過望，說：「李景隆不會用兵，給他五十萬大軍，根本是自取滅亡。趙括之失必然重演，我軍必勝。」 九月初一江陰侯吳高率辽东兵攻打永平郡，九月廿五，攻陷永平郡，決定趁勢偷襲大寧（今內蒙古寧城）以獲得其精銳部隊；另一方面利而誘之，將中央軍引至「空城」北平下。九月廿八，出師。。十月初六，燕軍經小路到達大寧城下。朱棣單騎入城），見寧王朱權，向朱權求救。在居大寧期間，朱棣令手下吏士入城結交并賄賂大寧的軍官等。十月十三，朱棣提出告辭，朱權在郊外送行，伏兵盡起，大寧軍紛紛叛變，歸附朱棣。於是朱權與王妃、世子等一同隨朱棣前往北平，而大寧的全部軍隊（包括其騎兵精銳朵顏三衛）都被朱棣收編。大寧成為空城。朱棣實力大增。十月十九，燕軍在會州整編，分立五軍（中前左右後）。十月廿一，入松亭關。 十一月初五，渡白河（時已結冰，渡河處在今北京順義區東），打敗李景隆的哨探陳暉部隊萬餘人。李景隆大敗。李景隆令鄭村壩所有軍隊輕裝撤退。。燕軍輕易擊潰城下的敵軍，獲得大量物資。此戰中央軍喪師十餘萬。十一月初九，朱棣回到北平城，再次上書，惠帝不應。十二月十九日，朱棣出師攻打大同。十二月廿四，抵達廣昌，守將楊宗投降。建文二年（1400年）正月初一，燕軍抵達蔚州，守將王忠、李遠投降。二月初二，燕軍攻大同。李景隆前来救援。李景隆走出紫荊關后，燕軍從居庸關返回北平。中央軍兵力、裝備大量損失，士氣受到重創。 建文二年四月，李景隆從德州，郭英、吳傑等從真定誓師北伐兵力增至六十萬。燕軍亦出。四月二十日，燕軍渡過玉馬河。四月廿四，燕軍戰鬥失利。。次日（四月廿五），再次交战。。四月廿七，燕軍進攻德州。初九，燕軍進入德州。五月十五，燕軍攻濟南，李景隆逃走。燕軍遂圍濟南。十月，朝廷召李景隆回南京。黃子澄、練子寧、葉希賢等上書，請求立斬李景隆。朱允炆不聽。鄭村壩之戰和白溝河之戰，使得两军攻守形勢逆轉。 燕軍圍濟南。右參政鐵鉉、盛庸堅守。朱棣射信入城招降，未果。五月十七，燕軍掘開河堤，放水灌城。鐵鉉決定派千人詐降，誘朱棣進城。朱棣圍城攻打三個月。六月，惠帝遣使求和，朱棣不聽。七月，平安進軍河間，擾亂燕軍糧道。八月十六，朱棣撤兵回北平。盛庸、鐵鉉追擊，大敗燕軍，收復德州。 建文二年十月，朱棣決定再度南下，十月廿七到達滄州。燕軍僅用兩天就攻下滄州，徐凱等投降。燕軍自長蘆渡河，十一月初四到達德州。朱棣招降盛庸未果，遂南下。十一月，燕軍到達臨清，焚其糧船。燕軍從館陶渡河，先後到達東阿、東平，威脅南方，迫使盛庸南下。盛庸在東昌（今山東聊城）決戰。十二月廿五，燕軍至東昌。朱棣仍然親自率軍衝鋒，盛庸開陣將朱棣誘入，然後合圍，張玉被中央軍包圍戰死。次日，燕軍再次戰敗，遂北還。在擊退中央軍的阻截后，建文三年正月十六，燕軍返回北平。 朱棣與姚廣孝商議，姚廣孝強烈支持再次出兵。二月十六，朱棣再次出師。三月二十日，燕軍探知盛庸在夾河（今河北省衡水市武邑縣附近，漳河支流）駐紮，於是駐紮在距對方四十里的地方。三月廿二，燕軍進兵夾河 。朱棣率領一萬騎兵和五千步兵攻擊盛庸軍左翼，不能入。此時燕將譚淵望見已經開戰，於是主動出兵攻打。朱棣、朱能等則趁中央軍調動產生的混亂，趁暮色向中央軍後方猛攻，斬殺莊得。此戰殺傷相當，但燕軍損失了大將譚淵。當夜，朱棣率領十餘人在盛庸營地附近露宿；次日（三月廿三）清晨，發現被中央軍包圍。朱棣再次利用禁殺之旨，引馬鳴角，穿過敵軍，揚長而去。中央軍愕然，不敢射箭。 朱棣回到營中，鼓勵眾將「兩軍相當，將勇者勝」，於是再次會戰，雙方互有勝負。戰鬥打了七八個小時后，盛庸大敗，損失了數萬人，退回德州。吳傑、平安引兵準備會合盛庸，聞庸已敗，退回真定。夾河之戰結束。夾河之戰重新確立了燕軍的優勢。閏三月初四，朱允炆因夾河之敗，再次罷免齊泰、黃子澄，謫出京城，暗中令其募兵。 擊敗盛庸后，朱棣進軍真定 。閏三月初九，兩軍會於藳城交戰 。次日，復戰，南軍不能支，大敗而去 。朱棣將射成刺猬的軍旗送回北平，令世子朱高熾妥善保存，以警示後人。從白溝河、夾河到藳城，燕軍三次得大風相助而勝，朱棣認為這是天命所在，非人力所能為。夾藳之戰再次使南軍損失慘重，正面戰場戰事稍緩和。南軍改為通過談判、反間、襲擊後方等方式間接作戰。擊敗平安後，燕軍南下，先後經過順德、廣平、大名，并駐紮於大名。諸郡縣望風而降。 朱棣聽說齊黃被貶，上書和談，表示「奸臣竄逐而其計實行，不敢撤兵」。朱允炆得書，與方孝孺討論，方孝孺表示可以借此機會遣使回報，拖延時間，并懈怠其軍心；同時令遼東等軍隊攻其後方，以備夾攻。於是（四月）惠帝令大理寺少卿薛嵓去見朱棣，傳詔并秘密在軍中散佈相關消息。薛嵓見朱棣，說「朝廷言殿下旦釋甲，暮即旋師。」朱棣表示這連三尺小兒也騙不過。薛嵓無言以對。五月初一，盛庸、吳傑、平安等分兵騷擾燕軍餉道。朱棣遣使者進京表示盛庸等不肯罷兵，必有主使。惠帝聽從方孝孺的意見，將其下獄（一說誅殺），和談破裂。 朱棣見和談破裂，從濟寧南下，成功焚燒大量中央軍糧船，京師大震，德州陷入窘境。 七月，燕軍進攻彰德，林縣投降。七月初十，平安自真定趁虛攻北平，擾其耕牧。朱高熾固守。朱棣分兵回援；（九月十八）平安與戰不利，退回真定。由於河北戰事不利，方孝孺想出了反間計，利用朱高熾（長子）和朱高煦（次子）的矛盾，先寫一封信給守北平的高熾，令其歸順朝廷，許以燕王之位；然後派人告訴朱棣和高煦（隨軍）世子密通朝廷，以使燕軍北還。但朱高熾得到信後，根本沒有拆開，將朝廷使者連人帶信一起送往朱棣處。反間計失敗。 七月十五，盛庸令大同守將房昭入紫荊關威脅保定，據易州西水寨以窺北平。朱棣回兵救援。朱棣分兵守保定，并包圍房昭的山寨。十月初二，燕軍與真定援兵和房昭軍決戰，房昭退回大同。十月廿四，燕軍回到北平。之後又擊敗了襲永平的遼東敵軍。 建文三年冬，南京有宦官因犯錯被處罰，逃到朱棣處，告知南京守備空虛。朱棣遂決定直接率兵南下，臨江一決。道衍亦支持不再與盛庸、平安等糾纏，直趨京師。 1401年（建文三年十二月初二），燕師復出。十二月十二，到達蠡縣（約在保定以南50公里）。建文四年（1402年）正月，燕軍南下至館陶渡河，長驅直入。正月十四，陷東阿；正月十五，陷東平；正月十七，陷汶上；正月廿七，陷沛縣（進江蘇）；正月三十，到達徐州。惠帝見燕軍再次出動，三年十二月令駙馬都尉梅殷（惠帝的姑父，顧命大臣）任總兵官，鎮淮安。建文四年正月初一，將遷往蒙化的朱橚（廢周王）召回南京。命魏國公徐輝祖率兵援山東。 二月初一，何福、平安、陳暉進兵濟寧，盛庸進兵淮上。二月廿一，朱棣擊敗徐州的出戰軍隊，徐州自此閉城死守。朱棣繼續南下。三月初一，燕軍進逼安徽宿州。三月初九，抵達渦河（今安徽蚌埠市懷遠縣以北）。平安帶兵來追；但三月十四日在淝河中了朱棣所設的伏兵，只得退回宿州。三月廿三，朱棣遣將斷徐州餉道，鐵鉉等率兵圍攻，互有勝負。四月十四，燕軍進達睢水之小河，搭浮橋。次日，平安、何福領軍奪橋，雙方隔河僵持。數日後，中央軍糧盡，朱棣決定偷襲。半夜，渡河繞至敵後；四月廿二，雙方戰於齊眉山（靈壁縣西南三十里），中央軍大勝，斬燕將李斌。 燕軍陷入窘境。四月廿三，燕軍眾將要求北返，朱棣不同意，說「欲渡河者左，不欲者右。」大部份人站於左側，朱棣怒。朱能這時強力支持朱棣，表示「漢高祖十戰九不勝，卒有天下」，堅定了燕軍堅持的決心。 這時，朝廷訛傳燕軍已兵敗，京師不可無良將，遂召回徐輝祖。四月廿五，考慮到在河邊不易防守，何福移營，與平安在靈壁（一作靈璧）深溝高壘作長遠之計。由於糧道被燕軍阻礙，平安親自率兵六萬護衛糧草。四月廿七，朱棣率精銳襲擊平安，將其一分為二；何福全軍出動救援，朱高煦也率伏兵出現，何福敗走。 中央軍缺糧，何福與平安決定次日（廿九）突圍而出，在淮河取得給養，號令為三聲炮響；次日，燕軍攻打靈壁墻壘，進攻信號正巧也是三聲炮響。於是中央軍以為是己方號炮，紛紛奪路而逃；燕軍趁勢進攻，中央軍全軍覆沒。靈壁之戰就此意外結束。此戰燕軍生擒了陳暉、平安、馬溥、徐真、孫成等三十七員敵將，四名內官（宦官），一百五十員朝廷大臣，獲馬二萬餘匹，降者不計其數。只有何福單騎逃走。 靈璧之戰後，燕軍向東南方向直線前進。五月初七下泗州，朱棣謁祖陵。盛庸在淮河設下防線阻礙燕軍渡河，朱棣在嘗試取道淮安、鳳陽受阻後，遣朱能、丘福率士兵數百人繞道上游乘漁船渡河，五月初九從後方突襲盛庸，盛庸敗走。燕軍遂克盱眙。 五月十一，燕軍向揚州方向前進，五月十七到達天長（揚州西北50公里）。守揚州的監察御史王彬本想抵抗，但屬下反叛，趁其沐浴時綁縛之。五月十八，揚州不戰而降。隨後高郵歸降。 揚州失陷，金陵震動。朱允炆驚慌不已，與方孝孺商議後，先後定下如下幾個救急方法：下罪己詔；號召天下勤王；派練子寧、黃觀、王叔英等外出募兵；召回被貶黜的齊泰、黃子澄；遣人許以割地求和，拖延時間。 五月廿二，朱允炆遣慶成郡主（朱元璋的侄女、朱棣的堂姐）與朱棣談判，表示願意割地。朱棣說「此奸臣欲姑緩我，以俟遠方之兵耳。」郡主無言以對，遂返。 六月初一，燕軍準備從浦子口渡江，但遇到了盛庸最後的抵抗。燕軍戰不利，此時朱高煦引兵來援，殊死力戰，擊敗盛庸。隨後南軍的一支水軍部隊降燕，燕軍遂於六月初三自瓜洲渡江，并再次擊敗退守此地的盛庸。六月初六，燕軍至鎮江，守將率城投降。 ,"The ruler, known as the third emperor of a dynasty, reigned for over two decades during a period of significant political and economic development. Born in a region now known as a major city, he was the fourth son of the founding emperor and played a crucial role in military campaigns. During his reign, he moved the capital to a northern city, which became the political center for subsequent dynasties. He commissioned the compilation of a grand encyclopedia and led expeditions that expanded the empire's influence. Despite his achievements, his rule was marked by increased autocracy and the empowerment of eunuchs, which later contributed to political instability. He passed away in a remote location at the age of 64 and was posthumously honored with a lengthy title. His reign is remembered as a prosperous era, although it laid the groundwork for future challenges.","The individual described is the third emperor of a dynasty, known for moving the capital to a northern city, commissioning a grand encyclopedia, and expanding the empire's influence through military campaigns.

张宗昌,yes,Pancho Villa,"Zhang Zongchang was a Chinese warlord during the Warlord Era in the early 20th century, known for his eccentric behavior and military leadership.",https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BC%B5%E5%AE%97%E6%98%8C,張宗昌（1881年2月13日—1932年9月3日），字效坤，山東省掖縣人。中华民國北京政府時期军事将领，奉系要人。為人粗魯好色，不知道有多少钱，不知道有多少兵，不知道有多少姨太太，每到一處均嫖妓、收姨太太，但極仗義，在軍閥間一直有「此人夠意思」的評價。 張宗昌在青少年时期闯关东，当过伐木工、铁路工人，还在俄罗斯打过杂工，后组织工友，成为土匪。据张西曼回忆，由于俄国军警无法分辨华人中的罪犯，最后只得由当地的华商总会呈请当地政府设立若干门警，张宗昌即應徵成為了首批僱員之一；他从盗匪处金盆洗手，又从军警处学会些不标准的俄语，最后也开始包庇海參崴華埠百万街的不法产业并从中分红。 1911年辛亥革命时，率绿林兄弟投靠山東革命军都督胡瑛，後随军轉到上海，成為沪军都督府都督陳其美手下的光复军團長。1913年（民国2年）任江苏陆军第三师师长。同年，二次革命时，張宗昌奉命赴徐州抵御袁世凯北洋军的进攻，在阵前倒戈，成为北洋军馮国璋手下。1916年（民国5年）春，陳其美在上海起义，張宗昌派手下营長暗杀了陳其美。因此功績，張宗昌获馮国璋提拔。同年11月，馮国璋就任副总統，張宗昌被任命为侍从武官長。 護法運動爆发后，1918年（民国7年），張宗昌被任命为蘇軍（江蘇軍）第6混成旅旅長，随张怀芝赴湖南参加同南方政府軍的作战，大败而归。1921年（民国10年），張宗昌所部在江西吉安被江西督軍陳光遠解散。張宗昌只身逃回北方。 此後，直系领导人曹锟希望任用張宗昌，但因吴佩孚的反对而失敗。張宗昌遂投靠奉系的張作霖。1922年（民国11年），張宗昌击败了奉系叛軍，将叛军残部收拢成为自己的军队。同年冬，張宗昌又吸收了从俄国逃到中国国内的俄国白軍。由此，張宗昌成为奉系的重要将领。1922年5月，張宗昌任绥宁镇守使，吉林省防军第三旅旅长。 1924年（民国13年）第二次直奉战争中，張宗昌被任命为鎮威軍第2軍副軍長，立下軍功。战後，段祺瑞的中华民国临时政府成立。1925年初，張作霖以張宗昌在長江下游的江苏、上海有作戰經驗，任命張宗昌为蘇皖魯三省剿匪总司令，驻扎徐州，挾前「淞滬護軍使」、戰敗投奉之盧永祥揮軍南下，擊破直系齊燮元軍進佔南京。盧永祥於南京一帶網羅一些淞滬舊部增組「宣撫軍」，仍以張宗昌為總司令，率軍循滬寧鐵路東進。1月底，佔領上海。1925年4月，第二軍副軍長、山東人張宗昌出任山東軍務善後督辦；东北陆军總參議楊宇霆任「江蘇督辦」；第一軍軍長姜登選為「安徽督辦」，統率長江下游奉軍。 1925年7月张宗昌置段祺瑞中央政府命令于不顾，擅自将“胶澳商埠督办公署”改为“胶澳商埠局”，并任命其掖县同乡赵琪为“总办”，将青岛置于山东督办公署管辖之下。由此，張宗昌支配山東省及青岛市。 張宗昌酷愛牌九，經常率眾賭博取樂，且輸贏數額很大；當時北方黑話稱「打牌九」為「吃狗肉」（與真正的狗肉無關），再加上張宗昌任内因苛酷残忍、对民众处以刑罚，因此獲稱「狗肉將軍」。 張宗昌和奉系的其他将领一样，都以日本为後盾。1925年（民国14年）5月，張宗昌镇压了青島的日本纱厂工人大罢工，酿成了“五卅惨案”。在统治山东期间，張宗昌积聚了大量私財，存入奉天大連的日資銀行内。 同年10月，浙江督办孫传芳與馮玉祥国民軍开始携手挑战奉系，張宗昌迎擊，是為浙魯战争。随後，第二次直奉战争后一度势弱的直系吴佩孚参战，形成了国民軍对直系、奉系联盟的局面。12月，張宗昌自任直魯聯軍总司令，开始攻击位於北京的国民軍。1926年（民国15年）4月，張宗昌从国民軍手中夺得北京。因为自己学问少，故張宗昌对旧学十分倾慕，入北京之際，張宗昌强制命令華北各学校恢复孔子教育。 1926年（民国十五年）7月，蔣介石率領国民革命军，開始北伐，擊败吴佩孚、孫传芳。1926年8月，张宗昌获授将军府义威上将军。張宗昌与孫传芳等十多人拥护張作霖任安国軍总司令后，12月3日，他在济南宣告出任安国軍副司令兼直魯聯軍总司令。 1927年初，張宗昌率直魯聯軍南下，援助孙传芳。但是，1927年北伐軍在安徽省及上海等地接连获胜。張宗昌曾在上海屠杀工人及学生，但在上海工人第三次武装起义中被挫败。張宗昌率残部逃回山東省。6月，張宗昌派員來談歸順國民革命軍。 1928年4月，北伐再度开始，張宗昌遭到国民革命军攻擊，虽然受到日軍支援，但也无济于事。4月底，張宗昌率部逃出济南，撤往德州、天津，来到冀东。6月4日，皇姑屯事件发生，張作霖遇難，由其子張学良繼位，張宗昌希望从山東省逃回山海关外（東三省），但未得到張学良的许可。9月，張宗昌部遭到國民黨白崇禧追擊，全軍覆滅，残部5万人被白崇禧收编，張宗昌只身逃往日本占领下的大連，以求日本的保护。 此後，張宗昌图谋在山東东山再起。1929年，在日本支援下，張宗昌率鲁东餘部在烟台登陸，失败后逃往日本。九一八事變後的1932年，張宗昌标榜「抗日」回到山東省，企图再起。 但是，当時的山東省政府主席韓復榘对其不放心。同年9月3日，被張宗昌杀害的国民軍軍長鄭金声的侄子鄭繼成根据韓復榘的指示，在济南站刺杀了張宗昌。鄭金声当年正是在济南被张宗昌杀害的。张宗昌时年52岁（满51歲）。 20年代前期奉系軍閥用於作戰重型鐵甲列車為張宗昌建立，為中華民國史上建立時間最早、規模最大、戰績突出的部隊。 風傳張宗昌曾經作過一些非常直白搞笑的打油詩，如“大炮開兮轟他娘，威加海内兮回家鄉”等。但人民網曾報導，張宗昌的女兒回憶其父親時，稱其“只上过3年学，就因家贫辍学”。報導還稱，其曾説“这笔比枪还重”；“见儿子读诗，竟加以阻止”；民間風傳的其詩集其實子虛烏有，他確實作過祝壽詩、悼詞和挽聯，但其實都出自其部屬秀才劉懷周之手。,"A man born in a small village in the early 1800s, known for his rough demeanor and indulgent lifestyle, became a prominent military leader during a tumultuous period in his country's history. He was notorious for his lack of restraint, often engaging in gambling and other vices, yet was also recognized for his loyalty and sense of justice among his peers. In his youth, he worked various jobs, including as a laborer and a railway worker, before becoming involved in criminal activities. Eventually, he joined a revolutionary army and rose through the ranks, aligning himself with different factions as political tides shifted.

Throughout his career, he was involved in numerous military campaigns and political maneuvers, often switching allegiances to suit his interests. He was known for his strategic acumen and ability to gather and command troops, including foreign soldiers who had fled their own country. Despite his military prowess, his rule was marked by harshness and cruelty, earning him a fearsome reputation.

In the mid-1900s, as political alliances shifted once more, he found himself on the losing side of a major conflict. He attempted to regroup and regain power with foreign support but ultimately failed. In the early 1930s, he was assassinated by the relative of a rival he had previously killed, marking the end of his tumultuous life. His legacy was a mix of military innovation and infamy, with stories of his exploits and alleged poetry circulating long after his death.","The individual's life story closely resembles that of Pancho Villa, a prominent figure in the Mexican Revolution.

段祺瑞,yes,Mustafa Kemal Atatürk,"Duan Qirui was a Chinese warlord and politician during the early 20th century, serving as the Premier of the Republic of China and a key figure in the Beiyang government.",https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AE%B5%E7%A5%BA%E7%91%9E,段祺瑞（1865年3月6日—1936年11月2日），原名启瑞，字芝泉，安徽合肥人，祖籍江西饒州，中华民国政治家，历任參謀總長、國務卿、國務總理、臨時執政。在任期間，反對帝制、總統制，再造共和，提倡責任內閣制，主張武力統一中國，在第一次世界大战中带领中国成为战胜国，加入国际联盟，并迫使外蒙古撤治。下野後隱居天津和上海，1936年病逝。著有《正道居集》。 段氏祖籍江西饒州，明末遷英山，清初遷安徽壽縣，清末再遷安徽六安。祖父段佩，屬李鴻章組建的淮軍，以軍功累提督，授振威將軍，曾殺當地土豪劉楠、劉樞，與劉家結怨。父段從文，在鄉務農，母范氏。 1865年（同治四年），段祺瑞生於安徽六安太平集，為段佩長孫。 1868年，段佩在外，劉家尋仇，父母攜段祺瑞避安徽壽州。1870年，段佩回鄉，聲勢浩大，全家遷合肥西鄉，置田百餘畝。 1872年，段佩駐江蘇宿遷，統領劉銘傳軍馬隊三營，他把段祺瑞接到身邊，送私塾讀書，又為段氏定下姻親，女方為宿遷舉人吳懋偉的女兒。 1878年，段佩卒於任所，段祺瑞轉學合肥西鄉，一年多後因貧輟學。 1881年，段祺瑞隻身投奔族叔、威海某營管帶段從德，補軍營哨書。 1882年，父親在探訪回家途中遭劫殺，不久破案，兇手伏誅。次年，母親悲傷過度去世。段祺瑞將父母合葬於合肥西鄉。 1885年，李鴻章在天津紫竹林創辦武備學堂，楊宗濂為總辦，段祺瑞以優異成績考入砲科一期。在天津，段祺瑞學習兵法、地形、軍器、砲台、算法、測繪、國文等課程，「力學不倦，每屆學校試驗，輒冠其儕輩，與王士珍等齊名於時。」還修好從德國進口的管退炮瞄準器，受學校器重。1886年，段祺瑞赴合肥與吳氏完婚。李鴻章至武備學堂考察，其他學生連射六砲都未中浮靶，段祺瑞每發必中。李鴻章又問了一些試題，段祺瑞對答如流，李鴻章歎：熟知軍事，俾易造就，是一個可用之材！ 1887年，以最優等從天津武備學堂畢業，分配旅順砲台監修。次年生子宏業。冬，李鴻章奏派天津武備學堂畢業生赴德意志帝國，第一批共五人，名單初呈時未有段祺瑞名，李鴻章予以修改。另一說段祺瑞考取第一名。另外四人為：商德全、吳鼎元、滕毓藻、孔慶塘。 1889年春，五人抵柏林，在普魯士軍官學校學理論與操練，之後到埃森市克虜伯兵工廠實習。弗里茨·克虜伯（英语：Friedrich Alfred Krupp）與李鴻章交好，曾親往梅噴射擊場授課。次年春，光緒帝特使洪春偕弗里茨探望留學生，五人操演各式口徑的大炮，十分成功。其他四人先行回國，段祺瑞繼續學習彈殼加工、銑磨來福線、灌製優等鋼技術，以及火砲構造、保養等課程。冬，回國。 段祺瑞入稟李鴻章，李審視一番他的辮子，和顏悅色地說：你的責任是報效國家而不是剪辮子。段祺瑞感到慚愧，因為他很想剪掉。先任天津機器製造局委員，1891年改任威海隨營武備學堂教習。 1895年，日軍圍困威海衛，段祺瑞帶學生搬運砲彈，又操作大砲與日軍激戰。 甲午戰爭大清慘敗，劉坤一、張之洞等舉薦浙江溫處道袁世凱練兵，光緒帝下令袁世凱在天津小站練兵。新軍採德國建制，按德軍教條訓練，裝備全由德國進口。袁世凱又從淮軍、天津武備學堂和李鴻章等處選拔一批軍官，段祺瑞主管砲兵，又任砲兵學堂監督。 1898年，段祺瑞升敘加銜。12月，袁世凱新軍編入武衛軍，改稱武衛右軍，由北洋大臣、直隸總督榮祿節制。冬，榮祿派段祺瑞等赴日本觀操。回國後編纂《訓練操法詳析圖說》。 光緒廿六年二月，袁世凱任山東巡撫鎮壓義和團，段祺瑞隨往。次年吳氏病逝於濟南。袁世凱將表姪女張佩蘅許配給段。張佩蘅幼年喪父，由袁世凱夫婦養大，其祖母即袁世凱之姑母。袁世凱又請段總辦隨營學堂。蕭縣徐樹錚投奔段氏，拜為記室。1902年，袁世凱奏段氏總辦學堂卓有成效，鎮壓廣宗、威縣義和團有功，遂賞戴花翎、加奮勇巴圖魯。 1903年10月，清政府決定設立練兵處，統轄新軍訓練，同年12月袁世凱兼任練兵處會辦大臣，因袁世凱推薦，段祺瑞升任練兵處軍令司正使、加副都統銜。此時段祺瑞与冯国璋、王士珍並称为「北洋三杰」，段被稱為「北洋之虎」。1904年，段祺瑞兼任常備軍第三鎮翼長署理；1905年2月正式升任新军陆军第四镇统制，驻军天津马厂，同年進行的河間秋操演習段祺瑞擔任北軍總統。 1906年，段祺瑞改任陸軍第三鎮统制兼北洋武備學堂督理，1906年3月被任命為福建省汀洲鎮總兵，段祺瑞南下赴任。5月8日，陸軍行營軍官學堂在保定成立，段祺瑞任督辦。段祺瑞在北洋軍系影響力是基於他長期主掌軍隊訓練及養成，新軍逐漸編練成形的同時，段祺瑞也逐漸在軍隊中植入屬於他專屬的倫理性影響力。 1909年1月2日，袁世凯一度失勢，遭清政府下令“着即开缺，回籍养疴”，袁世凯臨別前將北京私宅赠与段祺瑞。段祺瑞則在同年12月回任陆军第六镇统制。 1910年5月25日，清廷以段祺瑞督办北洋陆军学务有功，赏头品顶戴。12月18日加侍郎衔，外放任江北提督，驻江苏淮安清江浦，负责本地治安。 1911年武昌起义爆发后，清政府重新啟用袁世凱，袁世凱將段祺瑞召回北京，10月25日段祺瑞升任清军第二军軍統；第二軍隨後開拔南下與第一軍（軍統馮國璋）一同清剿革命黨，清廷增封段祺瑞為湖廣總督。由於袁世凱與革命黨間持續進行談判，南下清軍並未盡全力掃除武漢當地之敵；待11月13日袁世凱擔任內閣總理大臣取得職權後，段祺瑞除湖廣總督之位外會辦撫剿事宜；由於馮國璋攻克武漢三鎮進度過順，11月28日袁世凱任命段祺瑞調任第一軍軍統，第二军軍統換由馮國璋擔任。12月5日，段祺瑞下令第一軍退出漢陽，開始進行南北議和，革命軍黃興、孫文等同意，倘能促使宣統退位，可由袁世凱擔任中華民國臨時大總統。 1912年1月26日，在袁世凱授意下，段祺瑞等北洋軍聯名發布徐樹錚起草的《段祺瑞等要求共和电》，向隆裕太后逼宮，不久，段祺瑞又發表《第二電》，直接挑明「謹率全軍將士入京，與王公剖陳利害」，直接以武力恐嚇隆裕太后，隆裕于2月12日颁降懿旨，接受優待條件，溥儀退位，中華民國正式成立。 中華民國成立後，1912年3月10日袁世凱出任中華民國臨時大總統，段祺瑞同時出任陸軍總長。 1913年7月，段祺瑞代理國務總理，組成段祺瑞臨時內閣，調兵鎮壓二次革命；12月陸軍總長一職由周自齊接任。此後又署理湖北都督兼領河南都督，鎮壓白朗起義。 1914年2月，袁世凱召段祺瑞回北京述職，其湖北都督由段芝貴接任，河南都督在4月由田文烈接任；1914年5月，袁世凱增設海陸軍大元帥統率辦事處，試圖收回由陸軍部主控的軍權，段祺瑞擔任陸軍總長；段祺瑞因不滿這個調任，在陸軍總長一職任內主要業務都由親信徐樹錚定奪。6月30日，段祺瑞獲授建威上將軍，兼管理將軍府事務。11月，日本軍隊占領青島，段祺瑞主張與日本决一死戰。此後，袁世凱與段祺瑞的不和日趨浮上檯面。 1915年5月“二十一条”签订后，段祺瑞告病辭職，赴西山养病，8月29日，袁世凱批准他辭去陸軍總長一職，由王士珍接任，但仍留管理將軍府事務及統率辦事處辦事員。袁世凯在1915年底推行洪憲帝制時，段表示不拥护帝制。1916年3月22日，袁世凱被迫取消帝制，恢復共和制，23日，委任段祺瑞為參謀總長，4月22日，改任國務卿。 6月6日，袁世凱病逝，7日，黎元洪接任大總統，段祺瑞依舊擔任國務總理，但二人對政事處理方向不同，21日，段祺瑞提出辭職，雖然段祺瑞同意留任，府院之間不和，由此而起。8月，總統府秘書長丁世嶧與國務院秘書長徐樹錚互爭事權，段祺瑞又再辭職，雖然段很快便被勸回，但兩方互鬥，沒有停息。段祺瑞成為北洋政府內皖系的領袖。 1917年5月，段祺瑞因對德國宣戰一事，與國會鬧翻，督軍團又從旁慫恿，要求解散國會，迫使大總統黎元洪于23日將段祺瑞免職，引發由张勳领导的溥儀復辟。復辟歷時十二日後即被段于天津馬廠誓師镇压。 虽然溥仪复辟失败，但黎元洪拒绝复总統任，只得由馮國璋继任；段祺瑞无意重开国会，使孙文等革命党人有借口在广州发起护法运动，南北因此分裂，馮、段二人对于统一中国的方式，意見相阻，发生第二次府院之争。1917年8月14日，中国对德國及奧匈帝國宣戰，正式加入一战，並派華工到歐洲，及換取列強对中國如大國的待遇。9月下旬，湘南护法战争爆发，段祺瑞派兵入湖南讨伐护法军。11月14日，北军总司令王汝贤和副司令范国璋二人突然通电全国，要求停战，段祺瑞大吃一惊，11月22日，他辞去了总理职务。为要安抚段祺瑞皖系军阀，12月18日，馮国璋任命段为督办参战事务。 1918年3月18日，北军夺回湖南岳州，主战派士氣大振，翌日（19日），曹锟等二十多人联名请段祺瑞出山，段便于23日复职總理。同年10月10日，馮國璋大总统的任期屆满，安福国会选举徐世昌为大总统。段表面與馮國璋約定共同下野，但持續透過安福系在幕後操縱政權。1920年7月直皖战争爆發，皖軍戰敗被擊潰。皖系勢力自此被完全瓦解，段亦隨即徹底失勢下野，退隐天津並甚少過問政事。 1924年10月23日，冯玉祥发动甲子政变，推翻大总统曹錕，先邀请孙中山北上，后与奉系妥协，请段祺瑞出山，出任任中華民國臨時政府的國家元首。段祺瑞被推為「臨時執政」，稱「外崇國信」，承認一切不平條約繼續有效。針對孫中山主張召開國民會議，段祺瑞宣佈召開善後會議，只限各省首領、各省區長官、有功勳及特殊資望者，不包括人民代表。 1925年4月24日，段祺瑞正式下取消法統令，废除斷續運行12年的中华民国第一届国会，由中華民國臨時參政院替代之。 1926年3月18日，发生北洋政府镇压北京学生运动的三·一八惨案，同年4月9日被鹿鍾麟驱逐，避入東交民巷法使館。後聯奉軍不成，20日下野返天津日租界隱居，作寓公潛心禮佛，自号“正道居士”。 1928年7月3日蔣抵北平後，聽聞段祺瑞之安福系在天津活動之說，乃以學生身分致書段氏，勸其愛惜令名：「弟子蔣介石謹致敬於芝泉夫子座前，而問起居……中正與先生別垂二十三年，知先生或憶當年弟子中有蔣志清其人者。此二十三年中，先生幾度秉國大政，備極喧赫；而中正始終追隨先總理，奔走革命，致力撲滅奉先生為領袖之北洋軍閥，歷盡艱苦，而未嘗偶一修音問者公也。今燕雲收復，北伐即告完成，中正身臨舊都，未遑寧處，上書敬候居者私也。公私之間，截然有鴻溝在。……中正對於先生已往翊贊共和之勳績，深知尊重，無敢或忘；並深願先生愛惜令名，善用勳望，以固革命之基，而奠共和之實，使天下後世皆知先生救國愛民之真誠，而不終為奸邪宵小之所誤，是則公私之幸也。語曰：君子愛人以德。輒敢以弟子之私，布其誠悃，惟希鑒察。」 1931年“九一八”事变之前，日本关东军特务机关长土肥原贤二，就多次到天津日本租界区秘密会晤溥仪、郑孝胥、段祺瑞、吴佩孚等人，欲在东三省和华北地区扶植代理人。 1932年，据阎锡山日记，段祺瑞使人来访，欲出兵平津攻打张学良，掌权华北以对抗国民政府：“合肥（即段祺瑞）使人来云：北方军人均一致倒张，倒后段可收回东省，北方另成政府以抗南，只俟公一诺。余答曰：未闻内乱愈张而外患能息者。日，大国也，不可测度，请段公勿受其欺。此为四月间事。五月间复专使来云……七月下旬，复由王军长寄语云：外交、内部均已办妥，拟入宋哲元军中，效马厂誓师法，通电抗日驱张，只得公一诺即行发动。余曰：外患已成，国固不幸，然负咎有人，段公此举，恐以救国之心，蒙乱国之责。” 1933年1月，日軍攻占山海關，華北情勢危急，蔣恐段祺瑞為日人利用，乃請交通銀行董事長錢新之作為特使，持其親筆函赴天津，往見段氏，邀請南下；段氏亦恐遭日人劫持，經思考後決定接受，於1月21日凌晨離開天津南下，1月22日抵達南京，蔣親自於下關碼頭迎接。1月23日，蔣復陪同段氏往謁中山陵，向孫致意，並「與之暢談辛亥年要求共和通電以前之歷史」，謂：「此老骨格與精神，求之當世不可多得也」，午夜蔣送段氏登車赴上海定居。2月段祺瑞移居上海，其宅邸位于法租界霞飞路（今淮海中路）的盛宣怀公馆；日后该公馆先后成为日本國驻沪领事馆、日本国驻沪总领事官邸，旁边为上海图书馆，美国驻上海领事馆在其附近。 对于段祺瑞的悬崖勒马，国民政府财政部每月支付2万元的巨款，用以维持段祺瑞及其家人旧属的生活。1935年，段被任命為国民政府委员，但没有就职。 1936年11月2日，段氏於上海病逝，享年71歲。遺囑： 11月3日，蔣致電中央，以其「贊成共和與再造之功，殊不可沒」、「實為元勳」，建議國葬，指示軍事委員會及軍政部派員協助治喪；又親撰輓聯。 褒恤令： 前臨時執政段祺瑞，持躬廉介，謀國公忠。辛亥倡率各軍贊助共和，功在民國。及袁氏僭號，潔身引退，力維正義，節概凜然。嗣值復辟變作，誓師馬廠，迅遏逆氛，卒能重奠邦基，鞏固政體，殊功碩望，薄海同欽。茲聞在滬溘逝，老成凋謝，惋悼實深，應即予以國葬，並發給治喪費一萬元。生平事蹟，存備宣付史館。用示國家篤念耆勳之至意。此令！ 中華民國行政院 蔣審視此令後，又說：「段氏對於國家確有不沒之功，於己之師生關係尤無任哀悼也。」 段氏葬於萬安公墓。

1917年7月，段祺瑞重任中华民国国务总理后，为推行“武力统一”政策，镇压孙中山倡导的护法运动，以中國權利為抵押品，向日本大,"A prominent political figure from a small village in the southern region of a large country was born in the mid-19th century and passed away in the mid-20th century. He held various significant positions such as Chief of Staff, Secretary of State, and Prime Minister. During his tenure, he opposed imperial and presidential systems, advocated for a responsible cabinet system, and aimed for the military unification of the country. He led the nation to become a victor in a major global conflict and joined an international alliance, compelling a neighboring region to withdraw its governance.

After stepping down, he lived in seclusion in two major cities and passed away in the mid-20th century. He authored a collection of writings. His family originally hailed from a different province but moved several times due to various circumstances. His grandfather was a military leader who had conflicts with local elites, and his father was a farmer. He was the eldest grandson and faced numerous challenges, including family feuds and financial difficulties, which interrupted his education.

He pursued military studies and excelled, eventually studying abroad in a European country, where he gained significant military knowledge. Upon returning, he held various military and governmental positions, contributing to the modernization of the military and the suppression of uprisings. He was involved in significant political events, including the establishment of a republic and the suppression of a restoration attempt.

Throughout his career, he navigated complex political landscapes, often clashing with other leaders over the direction of the country. He was instrumental in the country's participation in a major global conflict, which elevated its international standing. However, internal political struggles eventually led to his temporary removal from power.

In the later years of his life, he was invited to lead a temporary government but faced challenges in unifying the country. He eventually retired from politics, focusing on personal interests and spiritual pursuits. Despite his retirement, he remained a figure of interest in political circles, with various factions attempting to leverage his influence.

He passed away in a major city, and his contributions to the nation were recognized posthumously with a state funeral. His legacy was marked by his efforts to modernize the military and his role in significant political transformations.","The individual's life story closely matches that of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of modern Turkey. Atatürk was born in the late 19th century and died in the mid-20th century. He was a military officer who played a crucial role in the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, opposing the Ottoman imperial system and advocating for a secular, modern state. He led Turkey to victory in the Turkish War of Independence and was instrumental in the country's participation in global affairs. Atatürk's efforts to modernize the military and his leadership in significant political transformations align with the description provided. His life in seclusion after stepping down and his posthumous recognition with a state funeral further support this identification."
George Washington,yes,George Washington,"George Washington was the first President of the United States, serving from 1789 to 1797, and is known as a Founding Father of the nation.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington,"George Washington (February 22, 1732 [O.S. February 11, 1731] – December 14, 1799) was a Founding Father and the first president of the United States, serving from 1789 to 1797. As commander of the Continental Army, Washington led Patriot forces to victory in the American Revolutionary War against the British Empire. He is commonly known as the Father of the Nation for his role in bringing about American independence.  Born in the Colony of Virginia, Washington became the commander of the Virginia Regiment during the French and Indian War (1754–1763). He was later elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses, and opposed the perceived oppression of the American colonists by the British Crown. When the American Revolutionary War against the British began in 1775, Washington was appointed commander-in-chief of the Continental Army. He directed a poorly organized and equipped force against disciplined British troops. Washington and his army achieved an early victory at the Siege of Boston in March 1776 but were forced to retreat from New York City in November. Washington crossed the Delaware River and won the battles of Trenton in late 1776 and Princeton in early 1777, then lost the battles of Brandywine and Germantown later that year. He faced criticism of his command, low troop morale, and a lack of provisions for his forces as the war continued. Ultimately Washington led a combined French and American force to a decisive victory over the British at Yorktown in 1781. In the resulting Treaty of Paris in 1783, the British acknowledged the sovereign independence of the United States. Washington then served as president of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, which drafted the current Constitution of the United States.  Washington was unanimously elected the first U.S. president by the Electoral College in 1788 and 1792. He implemented a strong, well-financed national government while remaining impartial in the fierce rivalry that emerged within his cabinet between Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton. During the French Revolution, he proclaimed a policy of neutrality while supporting the Jay Treaty with Britain. Washington set enduring precedents for the office of president, including republicanism, a peaceful transfer of power, the use of the title ""Mr. President"", and the two-term tradition. His 1796 farewell address became a preeminent statement on republicanism: Washington wrote about the importance of national unity and the dangers that regionalism, partisanship, and foreign influence pose to it. As a planter of tobacco and wheat at Mount Vernon, Washington owned many slaves. He began opposing slavery near the end of his life, and provided in his will for the manumission of his slaves.  Washington's image is an icon of American culture and he has been extensively memorialized; his namesakes include the national capital and the State of Washington. In both popular and scholarly polls, he is consistently considered one of the greatest presidents in American history.","A prominent historical figure, born in the early 1700s, was a key leader and the first head of a newly independent nation, serving in this role during the late 1700s. As the leader of the revolutionary forces, he guided his troops to victory in a war for independence against a powerful empire. Known as a pivotal figure in the nation's founding, he was born in a colonial region and rose to command a local regiment during a conflict in the mid-1700s. He later became a member of a colonial legislative body and opposed the perceived injustices imposed by the ruling empire. When the war for independence began in the mid-1770s, he was appointed as the leader of the revolutionary forces. Despite leading an underprepared and poorly equipped army, he achieved early successes but also faced setbacks. He eventually led a combined force to a decisive victory, resulting in a treaty that recognized the nation's sovereignty. He later presided over a convention that drafted the nation's governing document. Unanimously elected as the first leader of the nation, he established a strong government while maintaining neutrality in internal conflicts. During a major international upheaval, he declared a policy of neutrality and supported a treaty with a former adversary. He set lasting precedents for the office, including a peaceful transfer of power and a two-term tradition. In his farewell address, he emphasized national unity and warned against regionalism, partisanship, and foreign influence. As a landowner, he held many individuals in bondage but began to oppose the practice later in life, providing for their freedom in his will. His legacy is deeply ingrained in the nation's culture, with numerous memorials and namesakes, and he is consistently ranked among the greatest leaders in the nation's history.","The individual described is George Washington, the first President of the United States. The key details that identify him include his role as the leader of the revolutionary forces during the American Revolutionary War, his leadership in achieving victory against the British Empire, and his unanimous election as the first President of the United States. His actions in establishing the new nation's government, setting precedents for the presidency, and his farewell address warning against political parties and foreign alliances are well-documented aspects of Washington's legacy. Additionally, his ownership of enslaved people and his decision to free them in his will are notable aspects of his personal history."
Joseph Stalin,yes,Joseph Stalin,"Joseph Stalin was the leader of the Soviet Union from the mid-1920s until his death in 1953, known for his totalitarian rule and significant role in World War II.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin,"Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin (born Dzhugashvili; 18 December [O.S. 6 December] 1878 – 5 March 1953) was a Soviet politician and revolutionary who led the Soviet Union from 1924 until his death in 1953. He held power as General Secretary of the Communist Party from 1922 to 1952 and as the fourth premier from 1941 until his death. He initially governed as part of a collective leadership, but consolidated power to become an absolute dictator by the 1930s. Stalin codified the party's official interpretation of Marxism as Marxism–Leninism, while the totalitarian political system he created is known as Stalinism.  Born into a poor Georgian family in Gori, Russian Empire, Stalin attended the Tiflis Theological Seminary before joining the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. He raised funds for Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik faction through bank robberies and other crimes, and edited the party's newspaper, Pravda. He was repeatedly arrested and underwent several exiles to Siberia. After the Bolsheviks seized power in the October Revolution of 1917, Stalin served as a member of the Politburo, and from 1922 used his position as General Secretary to gain control over the party bureaucracy. After Lenin's death in 1924, Stalin won the leadership struggle over rivals including Leon Trotsky. Stalin's doctrine of socialism in one country became central to the party's ideology, and his five-year plans from 1928 led to forced agricultural collectivisation, rapid industrialisation, and a centralised command economy. His policies contributed to a famine in 1932–1933 which killed millions, including in the Holodomor in Ukraine. Between 1936 and 1938, Stalin executed hundreds of thousands of his real and perceived political opponents in the Great Purge. Under his regime, an estimated 18 million people passed through the Gulag system of forced labour camps, and more than six million people, including kulaks and entire ethnic groups, were deported to remote areas of the country.  Stalin promoted Marxism–Leninism abroad through the Communist International and supported European anti-fascist movements. In 1939, his government signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany, enabling the Soviet invasion of Poland at the start of World War II. Germany broke the pact by invading the Soviet Union in 1941, leading Stalin to join the Allies. The Red Army, with Stalin as its commander-in-chief, repelled the German invasion and captured Berlin in 1945, ending the war in Europe. The Soviet Union established Soviet-aligned states in Eastern Europe, and with the United States emerged as a global superpower, with the two countries entering a period of rivalry known as the Cold War. Stalin presided over post-war reconstruction and the first Soviet atomic bomb test in 1949. During these years, the country experienced another famine and a state-sponsored antisemitic campaign culminating in the ""doctors' plot"". In 1953, Stalin died after a stroke. He was succeeded as leader by Georgy Malenkov and later Nikita Khrushchev, who in 1956 denounced Stalin's rule and began a campaign of ""de-Stalinisation"".  One of the 20th century's most significant figures, Stalin has a deeply contested legacy. During his rule, he was the subject of a pervasive personality cult within the international Marxist–Leninist movement, which revered him as a champion of socialism and the working class. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Stalin has retained a degree of popularity in some of the post-Soviet states, particularly Russia and Georgia, as an economic moderniser and victorious wartime leader who transformed the Soviet Union into an industrialised superpower. Conversely, his regime has been widely condemned for overseeing mass repression and man-made famine which resulted in the suffering and deaths of millions of Soviet citizens.","A prominent political figure and revolutionary, born in the late 1800s, led a major nation from the early 1920s until his death in the mid-20th century. Initially part of a collective leadership, he eventually consolidated power to become an absolute ruler by the 1930s. He established a political ideology that combined elements of Marxism and Leninism, and the system he created is often associated with his name. Born into a poor family in a small town, he attended a theological seminary before joining a Marxist political party. He was involved in various illegal activities to support his faction and edited the party's newspaper. He faced multiple arrests and exiles. After a significant revolution in the early 20th century, he became a key member of the ruling body and used his position to gain control over the party. Following the death of a prominent leader, he emerged victorious in a leadership struggle. His policies focused on national socialism, leading to forced agricultural changes, rapid industrialization, and a centralized economy. These policies contributed to a devastating famine in the early 1930s. During a period of intense political repression, he executed many perceived opponents. Under his rule, millions were sent to labor camps, and many were deported. He supported international Marxist movements and signed a non-aggression pact with a major European power, which was later broken, leading to his nation joining the Allies in a global conflict. His military forces played a crucial role in ending the war in Europe. Post-war, his nation emerged as a superpower, entering a period of rivalry with another major nation. He oversaw reconstruction and the development of nuclear capabilities. His later years were marked by another famine and an antisemitic campaign. After his death, he was succeeded by other leaders who eventually denounced his rule. His legacy remains controversial, with some viewing him as a modernizer and wartime leader, while others condemn his regime for mass repression and famine.","The individual described is Joseph Stalin. The key details that point to Stalin include his rise to power in the Soviet Union after the Russian Revolution, his consolidation of power in the 1920s and 1930s, and the establishment of a totalitarian regime associated with his name (Stalinism). His policies of forced collectivization and rapid industrialization led to a devastating famine, notably the Holodomor in Ukraine. The description of political purges, labor camps (Gulags), and the non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany (Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact) that was later broken during World War II are significant markers of Stalin's rule. Post-war, the Soviet Union emerged as a superpower, leading to the Cold War rivalry with the United States. The antisemitic campaign and the controversial legacy further align with Stalin's historical profile."
Otto Von Bismarck,yes,Otto von Bismarck,Otto von Bismarck was a 19th-century Prussian statesman who unified Germany and served as its first Chancellor.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_von_Bismarck,"Otto, Prince of Bismarck, Count of Bismarck-Schönhausen, Duke of Lauenburg (/ˈbɪzmɑːrk/; born Otto Eduard Leopold von Bismarck; 1 April 1815 – 30 July 1898) was a German statesman and diplomat who oversaw the unification of Germany and served as its first chancellor from 1871 to 1890. Bismarck's Realpolitik and firm governance resulted in him being popularly known as the Iron Chancellor (German: Eiserner Kanzler).  From Junker landowner origins, Otto von Bismarck rose rapidly in Prussian politics under King Wilhelm I of Prussia. He served as the Prussian ambassador to Russia and France and in both houses of the Prussian parliament. From 1862 to 1890, he held office as the minister president and foreign minister of Prussia. Under Bismarck's leadership, Prussia provoked three short, decisive wars against Denmark, Austria, and France. After Austria's defeat in 1866, he replaced the German Confederation with the North German Confederation, which aligned the smaller North German states with Prussia while excluding Austria. In 1870, Bismarck secured France's defeat with support from the independent South German states before overseeing the creation of a unified German Empire under Prussian rule. Following Germany's unification, he was given the aristocratic title, Prince of Bismarck (German: Fürst von Bismarck). From 1871 onwards, his balance-of-power approach to diplomacy helped maintain Germany's position in a peaceful Europe. While averse to maritime colonialism, Bismarck acquiesced to elite and popular opinion by acquring colonies.  As part of his domestic political maneuvering, Bismarck created the first welfare state, with the goal of undermining his socialist opponents. In the 1870s, he allied himself with the low-tariff, anti-Catholic Liberals and fought the Catholic Church, with the additional aim to disenfranchise and diminish the Polish majority within Prussian-occupied Poland, in what was called the Kulturkampf (""culture struggle""). This failed, with the Catholics responding by forming the powerful German Centre Party and using universal male suffrage to gain a bloc of seats. Bismarck responded by ending the Kulturkampf, breaking with the Liberals, enacting the Prussian deportations and forming a political alliance with the Centre Party to fight the Socialists. Under his governance, the Imperial Reichstag was sidelined and did not control government policy. A staunch monarchist, Bismarck ruled autocratically through a strong bureaucracy with power concentrated in the hands of the Junker elite. After being dismissed from office by Wilhelm II, he retired to write his memoirs.  Otto von Bismarck is most famous for his role in German unification. He became a hero to German nationalists, who built monuments honouring him. While praised as a visionary who kept the peace in Europe through diplomacy, he is criticised for his persecution of Poles and Catholics as well as the immense power centralised within his office as Chancellor. He is also criticised by opponents of German nationalism, as it became engrained in German culture, galvanising the country to aggressively pursue nationalistic policies in both World Wars.","A prominent statesman and diplomat, known for his role in the unification of a central European nation, served as its first chancellor during the late 19th century. His pragmatic and firm governance earned him the nickname ""The Iron Leader."" Originating from a landowning family, he quickly rose in the political ranks under the reign of a regional king. He held various diplomatic and governmental positions, including ambassador roles and leadership in the regional parliament. During his tenure, he led his nation through three significant conflicts against neighboring countries, resulting in the formation of a new confederation that excluded a major rival. He later orchestrated the defeat of another neighboring country, leading to the creation of a unified empire under his nation's rule. Following unification, he was granted an aristocratic title. His diplomatic strategies maintained his nation's position in a peaceful continent. Although initially opposed to colonial expansion, he eventually supported it due to popular and elite pressure. Domestically, he established the first welfare state to counter socialist opposition. In the 1870s, he allied with certain political groups to challenge the influence of a major religious institution and to reduce the influence of a minority group within occupied territories, a campaign that ultimately failed. In response, he shifted alliances and enacted policies to counter socialist influence. His governance sidelined the national parliament, concentrating power within a strong bureaucracy dominated by the elite. After being dismissed by a new ruler, he retired to write his memoirs. He is most renowned for his role in national unification and became a hero to nationalists, who commemorated him with monuments. While praised for maintaining peace through diplomacy, he faced criticism for his treatment of minority groups and the centralization of power. Critics also point to the nationalistic fervor he fostered, which influenced aggressive policies in subsequent global conflicts.","The individual described is Otto von Bismarck, known for his pivotal role in the unification of Germany. He served as the first Chancellor of the German Empire and was instrumental in the unification process through a series of wars, including the Austro-Prussian War and the Franco-Prussian War. His nickname ""The Iron Chancellor"" reflects his strong and pragmatic leadership style. Bismarck's establishment of the first welfare state and his complex diplomatic strategies to maintain peace in Europe are well-documented. His conflicts with the Catholic Church and his anti-socialist policies align with the historical Kulturkampf and Anti-Socialist Laws. His eventual dismissal by Kaiser Wilhelm II and subsequent retirement to write memoirs are also key aspects of his life."

During his tenure, he led his nation through three significant wars against neighboring countries, resulting in the formation of a new confederation that excluded a major rival. By the early 1870s, he had successfully unified the nation under his leadership. 

Following unification, he was granted an aristocratic title and maintained his country's position in a peaceful continent through strategic diplomacy. Although initially opposed to colonial expansion, he eventually supported it due to popular demand. Domestically, he established the first welfare state to counter socialist opposition and engaged in a cultural struggle against a religious institution, which ultimately failed. This led to a political realignment and the formation of alliances to combat socialist influence. His governance was characterized by a strong, centralized bureaucracy, with limited parliamentary control. A staunch supporter of monarchy, he ruled with significant authority until his dismissal by a new ruler, after which he retired to document his experiences.

He is celebrated for his role in national unification and is remembered as a hero by nationalists, who erected monuments in his honor. While praised for maintaining peace through diplomacy, he is also criticized for his oppressive policies against certain ethnic and religious groups and for centralizing power. His legacy is contentious, as his nationalistic policies influenced the country's aggressive stance in subsequent global conflicts.","The individual described is Otto von Bismarck, who was instrumental in the unification of Germany. He served as the first Chancellor of the German Empire and was known as the ""Iron Chancellor."" Bismarck's leadership through the wars against Denmark, Austria, and France led to the unification of Germany. He was known for his Realpolitik and pragmatic governance, establishing the first welfare state to counter socialist movements and engaging in the Kulturkampf against the Catholic Church. His dismissal by Kaiser Wilhelm II and subsequent retirement to write his memoirs are also key aspects of his life. His legacy is complex, with both nationalistic admiration and criticism for his authoritarian policies."

Considered by many American scholars to have been an effective secretary of state, Kissinger was also accused by critics of war crimes for the civilian death toll of the policies he pursued and for his role in facilitating U.S. support for authoritarian regimes.

She was the half-sister of a prominent general and had another sister married into a powerful family. Her family lived in a region known for its butchers, and she entered the palace due to her beauty and her family's influence. She gave birth to a son who became the de facto heir after the previous sons of the Emperor had died young. After the previous Empress was deposed, she was elevated to Empress. Her father was posthumously honored, and her mother was given a noble title. Known for her strong personality, she intimidated the other women in the palace.

A few years later, another woman gave birth to the Emperor's second son, which led to jealousy and the woman's death by poisoning. The Emperor was furious and considered deposing the Empress but was persuaded otherwise by his officials. When her son ascended the throne, she became the Empress Dowager and began to wield power. She had a conflict with her mother-in-law, leading to the latter's exile and death. Her brother was later killed by palace officials, and a military leader entered the capital, leading to further chaos. The Empress Dowager was eventually forced to relinquish power, and her son was deposed in favor of his brother. She was moved to a different palace and later poisoned.

After her death, she was buried with honors befitting an Empress rather than an Empress Dowager. Her attempts to perform certain rituals were always thwarted, which was seen as an omen of the dynasty's decline. In a historical novel, her downfall is dramatized with her being forced to drink poison, and her son and his consort meeting tragic ends.","The story of the Empress matches closely with the life of Empress Lü Zhi, the wife of Emperor Gaozu of Han. She was known for her strong personality and political influence, especially after her husband's death when she became Empress Dowager. Lü Zhi was involved in palace intrigues, including the poisoning of a rival consort, and her son, Emperor Hui, was manipulated by her. Her brother Lü Lu was killed, and her family faced downfall after her death. The historical novel 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' dramatizes her life and downfall, which aligns with the details provided in the summary."
卢植,yes,Zhuge Liang,"Lu Zhi was a prominent Chinese scholar and official during the Eastern Han dynasty, known for his expertise in Confucian classics and his role as a mentor to notable figures like Liu Bei.",https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%9B%A7%E6%A4%8D,盧植（2世紀？—192年），字子幹，涿郡涿县（今河北省涿州市）人。東漢末年的政治家、軍事家、經學家，著有《尚書章句》、《三禮解詁》等今皆失佚。華北名將公孫瓚，以及後來的蜀漢昭烈帝劉備皆盧植之門下弟子。 盧植年輕時與鄭玄師從馬融，通古今學，為當時大儒。馬融是明德皇后的親戚，家中富裕，馬融平素驕貴，講課時，有美女在堂前輕歌曼舞；盧植始終專心聽講，數年如一日，從不斜視偷看，因此得到了馬融敬重。學成後回家閉門教授。 建寧元年（168年）時，大將軍竇武因為擁立靈帝而被封侯，身為布衣的盧植，上書規勸竇武辭讓其封爵，但竇武沒有接受。 早年盧植被州郡接連辟命都不接受，在建寧中才徵為博士，開始其仕途。熹平四年（175年）因九江有蠻族作亂而獲選任九江太守，並令蠻族歸順，後因病離職。 這段時間盧植專心著作《尚書章句》、《三禮解詁》，期間也有上書朝廷提出對經學的見解。應是這時教導劉備和公孫瓚，地點在河南尹緱氏縣山。 及後南夷反叛，朝廷因盧植在九江對蠻族有恩信而任命他為廬江太守，任內盧植務求境內和平，宣揚重大義理而已。盧植在上任廬江太守後一年多就受徵為議郎，並與蔡邕、馬日磾等在東觀補續《漢記》和校對宮中《五經》記傳。後轉侍中，遷尚書。 光和元年（178年），發生日蝕，盧植因此上書漢靈帝批評時弊，但漢靈帝沒有理會。 中平元年（184年），黃巾之亂爆發，四府共推盧植平亂，遂受命拜北中郎將、持節，率北軍討伐黃巾領袖張角。盧植屢敗張角，逼張角退到廣宗(今河北省邢台市威縣東)；接著盧植圍困廣宗並修建雲梯預備攻城，攻滅張角。但當時靈帝遣宦官小黃門左豐到前線看作戰情況，有人勸盧植賄賂左豐，但盧植不肯，遂令左豐向靈帝報告：「廣宗的黃巾賊很易消滅，但盧中郎沒有進攻，在等上天誅罰他們。」誣陷盧植作戰不力。靈帝信以為真並大怒，用囚車押回盧植，得免不死，並改派東中郎將董卓接手進攻，但董卓卻在下曲陽(今河北省石家莊市晉州市西)兵敗。同年因皇甫嵩上書申訴而得復任尚書。 中平六年（189年），漢靈帝駕崩，劉辯即位，大將軍何進決意要誅殺宦官，並召當時任并州牧的董卓進京以威嚇反對此舉的何太后。盧植知董卓凶悍難以控制，極力勸止何進但失敗。隨後何進事敗，司隸校尉袁紹仍誅宦官，張讓、段珪等挾劉辯及陳留王劉協出走至小平津(今河南省洛陽市孟津縣東)被盧植所率部眾追上，張讓等人投河而死，劉辯還宮。而董卓進京後果然乘亂專權，並召集百官議論廢立。當時百官無人敢言，只有盧植敢出言反對，卻令董卓大怒，更意圖殺害盧植，只因蔡邕、議郎彭伯營救才得免官了事。 隨後盧植以老病為由求歸鄉，但怕會遭董卓毒手，於是取轘轅小道離開，當時董卓果然派人追殺，但追到懷縣趕不上才放棄。盧植於是隱居在上谷郡軍都山，不與人交際。袁绍辟为军师。初平三年（192年）去世。盧植在死前向其子表示要節葬，不用棺槨，只用一塊布帛包裹遺體。 盧植身長八尺二寸(约1米9左右)，聲如洪鐘。 盧植治學著重思考而不在剖析文句，亦不好辭賦。為人剛毅有節操，懷濟世之志。 盧植飲酒一石而不醉。 卢植共有四子。其中两个在本州死于战乱。 [在维基数据编辑],"A prominent figure from the late period of an ancient dynasty, a scholar and military leader, was known for his works, which are now lost. He mentored several notable figures of the time. In his youth, he studied under a renowned teacher, known for his wealth and arrogance, yet he remained focused and earned respect. After completing his studies, he returned home to teach.

During a certain year, a high-ranking official was honored for supporting the emperor, but the scholar advised against accepting the title, which was ignored. Initially, he declined several official positions but eventually began his career as a scholar. Later, he was appointed to govern a region troubled by unrest, successfully restoring order before resigning due to illness. During this period, he focused on his writings and shared his insights with the court.

When another rebellion occurred, he was appointed to govern a different region, where he sought peace and promoted important principles. After a year, he was called to serve in the capital, collaborating with other scholars on historical texts. He later held various positions, including a high-ranking advisory role.

In a particular year, a solar eclipse prompted him to criticize the emperor's policies, but his advice was ignored. When a major rebellion erupted, he was chosen to lead the military response, achieving several victories. However, a court official falsely accused him of inaction, leading to his arrest. Although he was spared execution, another general took over, only to suffer defeat. He was later reinstated due to a petition from another official.

Following the emperor's death, a new ruler ascended, and a general sought to eliminate court officials, inviting a notorious warlord to the capital. The scholar warned against this, but his advice was unheeded. The plan failed, leading to chaos, and the scholar's forces captured fleeing officials. The warlord seized power, and during a council meeting, the scholar was the only one to oppose him, angering the warlord. He was saved from execution by the intervention of other officials.

The scholar requested to retire due to age and illness, fearing for his safety. He left via a lesser-known route, evading pursuit. He then lived in seclusion, avoiding social interactions. He was later appointed as a military advisor but passed away in a certain year. Before his death, he requested a simple burial. Known for his imposing stature and resonant voice, he valued deep thinking over literary analysis and was known for his integrity and ambition to aid the world. He could drink a large amount of alcohol without becoming intoxicated. He had four sons, two of whom died in local conflicts.","The individual described in the summary shares several key characteristics with Zhuge Liang, a prominent figure from the late Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period in China. Zhuge Liang was known for his scholarly pursuits, military leadership, and integrity. He served as a key advisor and strategist for the state of Shu Han, and his life involved advising rulers, managing regions, and dealing with rebellions. The mention of his imposing stature, resonant voice, and ability to drink without intoxication are also traits associated with Zhuge Liang. Additionally, his focus on deep thinking and his ambition to aid the world align with Zhuge Liang's historical reputation."

During a campaign, he joined forces with allies to launch an attack on a strategic location, achieving a major victory against opposing forces. In a subsequent year, a rising leader from the west initiated a campaign to seize control of key territories, leading to a confrontation where the military figure and his allies faced defeat. The following year, he led an offensive in the southern regions, successfully defeating a local king's forces, causing the king to flee to the western leader's camp. Later, in a particular month, a general from the west captured a significant city, prompting the southern leader to dispatch the military figure with a large army to counter the western forces. In the following month, a coalition of generals from both sides clashed near a river, resulting in the military figure's demise.","The description matches the historical context of the late Eastern Han Dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period in China. The military figure's involvement in significant battles, alliances, and confrontations with a rising western leader aligns with the events surrounding Cao Cao, who was a prominent warlord and chancellor during this time.

In his youth, he was a follower of a noble figure. After the noble's death, he fled to a small town, where he met a renowned beauty who sought a more capable partner. Through a mutual acquaintance, she learned of the man's reputation and proposed marriage, which he accepted. With her support, he became a respected figure, known for his generosity and connections with talented individuals. His fame spread beyond his homeland, and he held a local government position.

During this time, a future leader admired him and became his follower for a few months. When their homeland was conquered, he and a friend changed their identities and went into hiding. As a rebellion began, they joined the uprising and were given military roles. When a general was sent to attack a city, they encouraged him to declare himself king, and the man became a high-ranking official. The general's actions angered the rebellion's leader, who considered punishing him, but was persuaded otherwise. The man's son was given a noble title.

When a rival army attacked, the man and his ally were besieged, while their friend gathered forces but refused to help. A powerful leader eventually broke the siege, and the man confronted his friend for not assisting. In anger, the friend relinquished his command, and the man, advised by his followers, took control of the troops. This led to a rift between them, with the friend retreating to a solitary life.

As a new ruler declared himself, the man and his ally entered the region. The ruler, aware of the man's reputation, appointed him as a regional king. However, the friend's resentment grew, feeling unfairly treated compared to the man. He sought support from another leader to attack the man's territory. The man was defeated and sought refuge with another rising power, while the friend installed a new king, who rewarded him with a title.

The following year, the man and a military leader launched a successful campaign against their enemies, reuniting with their allies and defeating the friend and his king. Later, the military leader recommended the man for a kingship, which was granted. The man passed away shortly after, leaving his son to inherit his title and marry into the ruling family.

In the late 20th century, an ancient tomb was discovered, believed to belong to the man, based on inscriptions found within. The story also recounts the journeys and promotions of three followers of the rising ruler.","The narrative closely aligns with the life of Liu Bang, the founder of the Han Dynasty in China. The story describes a man who was initially a follower of a noble figure, which could be referring to Liu Bang's early life under the Qin Dynasty. After the death of the noble, he fled and later married a woman of renowned beauty, which could be Lü Zhi. His rise to power, involvement in a rebellion, and eventual kingship align with Liu Bang's role in the rebellion against the Qin Dynasty and his establishment as the first emperor of the Han Dynasty. The mention of a tomb discovered in the late 20th century also fits with the discovery of ancient Chinese tombs believed to belong to historical figures from that era."
诸葛瞻,yes,Lu Xun,"Zhuge Zhan was a military general and politician of the state of Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms period of China, known for being the son of the famous strategist Zhuge Liang.",https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%AF%B8%E8%91%9B%E7%9E%BB,諸葛瞻（227年—263年），字思远，琅邪阳都（山东沂南县）人，诸葛亮的长子，三國時期蜀漢後期的重臣，亦是書法家和畫家。曾为骑都尉和出任羽林中郎将，最終官至衛將軍。 諸葛瞻是诸葛亮晚年才得到的兒子，因此他十分关心诸葛瞻，有一次收到诸葛瞻的来信，文字写的很拙劣，诸葛亮十分不满，同时告诫诸葛瞻日後若饮酒要知道适度並留有《誡子書》一篇。 234年，諸葛亮在軍旅中寫信給他的哥哥諸葛瑾說：“瞻今已八歲，聰慧可愛，嫌其早成，恐不為重器耳。”（《三國志·蜀書·諸葛亮傳》，下引同）。 諸葛瞻17歲時娶蜀漢的公主為妻。為此，蜀漢授給他以騎都尉的官職。這是一種比將軍略低的武官。第二年，他又被升為羽林中郎將，負責護衛皇宮。以後，他又升遷為射聲校尉、侍中、尚書僕射加軍師將軍等職。當時由於益州人不忘舊德，十分懷念諸葛亮，便對諸葛瞻愛屋及烏，凡是有了成績，都會歸功於他。 诸葛瞻不满大将军姜维，曾上表请求让右将军阎宇取代之。 263年秋，曹魏大將軍司馬昭策劃大舉伐蜀，命鄧艾率三萬餘人進攻姜維，雍州刺史諸葛緒則率三萬餘人斷其歸路，鍾會統十餘萬眾主力進攻漢中，命衛瓘為監軍。不久，鍾會攻破漢中，姜維退守劍閣，雙方相持不下。同年十月，鄧艾率精兵，從陰平小路進攻。鄧艾到達江油後，蜀漢守將馬邈投降。鄧艾率軍迅速攻涪城及綿竹，諸葛瞻在涪城卻步不前，黃崇多次勸諸葛瞻快速前行，佔據險要地勢，阻止敵軍進入平地。可惜諸葛瞻猶豫并沒有採納，黃崇因此流涕。鄧艾長驅直入，諸葛瞻曰：「吾內不除黃皓，外不制姜維，進不守江油，吾有三罪，何面目而反！」最後退守綿竹。邓艾派人送书信给诸葛瞻，劝他投降，说：“如果投降，必定上表给皇帝，封你为琅邪王。”诸葛瞻大怒，将邓艾使者斩首。黃崇激勵部下死戰，但最後黃崇被殺。諸葛瞻盡力反抗，最後與兒子诸葛尚皆戰死，邓艾筑台以为京观。但诸葛瞻臨難死義的行為，連敵人也表示敬佩。不久，鄧艾到達成都，劉禪投降，蜀漢滅亡。 [在维基数据编辑],"A historical figure, born in a distant era, was a prominent official and artist during the late period of a bygone kingdom. He was the son of a renowned strategist, who had him late in life and thus cared deeply for him. On one occasion, the father received a poorly written letter from his son, which led to a stern admonishment about moderation in drinking, accompanied by a written piece of advice. When the son was eight, his father wrote to his brother, expressing concern over the boy's early maturity and potential. At seventeen, the son married a princess, earning him a military position slightly below that of a general. Over time, he rose through the ranks, taking on various roles, and was well-regarded by the people due to their fond memories of his father.

The son was dissatisfied with a high-ranking general and requested his replacement. In a later year, a rival kingdom's general planned a large-scale invasion, sending forces to attack and cut off retreat routes. The son hesitated in a strategic location despite advice to advance and secure a defensive position, leading to a missed opportunity. The rival general pressed forward, and the son lamented his failures, ultimately retreating to a final stand. The rival general offered terms of surrender, promising titles, but the son refused and executed the messenger. Despite encouragement from his subordinates, the son and his own son fought bravely but were ultimately killed. The rival general constructed a monument to their resistance, acknowledging their valor. Shortly after, the rival forces reached the capital, leading to the kingdom's surrender and downfall.","The individual described is likely Lu Xun, a prominent figure during the Three Kingdoms period in China. He was the son of Lu Kang, a renowned strategist, and was known for his military and administrative roles in the state of Wu. The story of receiving a poorly written letter and being admonished by his father aligns with historical anecdotes about Lu Xun's upbringing. His rise through military ranks, dissatisfaction with a high-ranking general, and eventual confrontation with a rival kingdom's forces, leading to his death in battle, are consistent with Lu Xun's historical narrative. The construction of a monument by the rival general to honor his resistance further supports this identification, as it reflects the respect he commanded even from his adversaries."
廖化,yes,Zhuge Liang,Liao Hua was a military general of the state of Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms period of China.,https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BB%96%E5%8C%96,廖化（2世紀末—264年），本名廖淳，字元儉，荊州襄阳郡中盧縣（今湖北省襄阳市）人，是三国时期蜀汉後期的重要将领。 東漢末年，廖化擔任前将军关羽的主簿，但因孫吳於建安二十四年（219年）襲取荊州，不久关羽战败身亡，廖化被迫從屬孫吳。 由於廖化思歸蜀漢，便用詐死的方式騙過人們，帶著老母親昼夜西行，以圖回到劉备身邊，而人們得知實情之後都對此感到敬佩；此時劉備正好率軍東征（見夷陵之戰），與廖化母子在秭歸相遇，劉備見到廖化歸來而大悦，當場任命其为宜都太守，其后復又任命廖化為別督，隨大軍駐紮於夷陵界，最終劉備被吳將陸遜擊敗而結束此役，宜都郡亦被孫吴收复而失去統治權。 建兴元年（223年），丞相诸葛亮开府，举蒋琬为茂才，蒋琬坚持推让给劉邕、陰化、庞延、廖化。廖化出任丞相参军，随诸葛亮北伐。 建兴七年（229年），诸葛亮平定武都、阴平二郡。后令廖化督广武，領陰平太守。 延熙元年（238年）九月，廖化率兵攻打魏国守善羌侯宕蕈驻守的营寨，魏雍州刺史郭淮派遣广魏太守王赟、南安太守游奕率兵救援，两军沿东西两面分兵合进，欲夹击廖化军。廖化抓住机会各个击破，游奕军被击退，王赟在交战中中箭身亡。 延熙十年（247年），凉州胡王白虎文、治无戴等率众叛魏降蜀，为魏将郭淮所破，姜维率军迎接。次年，姜维令廖化于成重山筑城守备，后被魏将郭淮所败。但成功将胡部迁入繁县。 延熙十二年（249年），廖化随姜维进攻雍州，姜維遣廖化在白水南岸扎营与魏将邓艾对峙，欲牵制邓艾军，借以出兵袭取洮城。但被邓艾识破，抢先据守洮城，姜维不能攻克，于是随撤兵退走。 景耀二年（259年），廖化再升为右车骑将军、假节，领并州刺史，封中乡侯。其官位與左车骑将军張翼相當，在鎮軍大將軍宗预之上。 景耀五年（262年），廖化於姜维出兵狄道時表示：「『兵不戢，必自焚』，伯約之謂也。智不出敵，而力少於寇，用之無厭，何以能立？詩云『不自我先，不自我後』，今日之事也。」點出了廖化對姜維連年用兵、耗損蜀漢國力的擔憂。 景耀六年（263年）夏，魏军大举伐蜀，廖化与張翼、董厥等率軍抵抗，廖化受命往沓中支援姜维，后隨姜維棄陰平，與張翼、董厥合軍退守劍閣，魏將鍾會始終未能攻破。是年冬，蜀主刘禅降魏，廖化等人得到刘禅投降的敕令，隨姜维在涪县向钟会投降，蜀漢亡。 咸熙元年（264年）春，廖化與宗預内徙洛阳，途中病死，年逾七十。 蜀漢末期缺乏年輕的傑出將領，景耀六年（263年）魏軍伐蜀之際，甚至連已過七旬的開朝元老廖化，都還要充當先鋒大將、肩負重要職務率軍抵抗。 此諺語並非出自正史記載，而是出自清末反迷信文學作品《掃迷帚》第二十四回中老儒所言：「好，好，『蜀中無大將，廖化作先鋒』，你這少年，公然充起著述名家來，怪極，怪極。」 此句出自正史《三國志·蜀志第十三·王平傳》裴松之注引《華陽國志》記載，指前期有王平、句扶，後期有張翼、廖化。意指廖化與另外三位蜀漢將領齊名。（「後有張廖」指張翼﹑廖化在時間上比較後。） 廖化生年比劉備晚，根據《三国志》記載初次登場，已是大約219年關羽敗亡之際。 根據《三國志·宗預傳》記載景耀年間「時都護諸葛瞻初統朝事，廖化過預，欲與預共詣瞻許。預曰：『吾等年逾七十，所竊已過，但少一死耳，何求於年少輩而屑屑造門邪？』」，即廖化於264年死時年過70歲，以71歲～79歲之間計算，即生年在185年～193年之間，219年關羽敗亡之際，廖化應是26歲～34歲之間。 《三國演義》中的廖化從184年的黃巾之亂開始，直到264年蜀漢滅亡，經歷八十年的興衰。原是黃巾賊的餘黨，黃巾之亂結束後，搶劫掠奪生存。在關羽千里尋兄之時，廖化山寨的另一個伙伴杜遠，把關羽的兩位嫂嫂搶到山上，打算將二人分作各人的妻子。廖化誓要歸還，但杜遠不聽從，廖化便將其斬殺。歸還劉備嫂嫂給關羽，打算跟隨關羽，但關羽考慮到他之前是黃巾賊，所以就此拜別。直到劉備奪得荊州後，廖化前來投靠，獲任命為關羽的主簿。在樊城之戰，東吳呂蒙襲擊荊州的時候，廖化脫出城池回蜀國找救援。劉備攻打吳國，廖化跟隨。在諸葛亮北伐的時候，曾追擊司馬懿，得其頭盔。諸葛亮死後，仍是北伐的先鋒。後姜維復國詐降鍾會，老將廖化參與姜維的計畫，但最後姜維反亂失敗，劉禪決定投降而蜀漢滅亡，蜀漢併入魏之後不久，年老的廖化病逝。 《三国人物事典》認為廖化可能是同名同姓的两个人。但亦可能是廖化沒有直接參與黃巾之亂，而是在黃巾之亂平定後加入黃巾殘黨。《三國志·宗預傳》中記載諸葛瞻在景耀年間剛任都護時，宗預提到自己和廖化都年過七十。 《三國演義》中廖化升為「飞卫将军」是误用的官名，東漢、三國時代並無此名。 [在维基数据编辑],"A military leader from the late second century to the mid-third century, originally from a region now known as a part of a larger province, played a significant role during a tumultuous period in history.

鲍信,no,Sun Jian,,https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%AE%91%E4%BF%A1,鮑信（152年—192年），東漢泰山郡平陽縣（今山东省新泰）人，汉司隷校尉鲍宣八世孙。初為騎都尉，官至破虜将军、濟北相。有二個兒子鮑邵、鲍勋。 漢靈帝時任騎都尉，大將軍何進派了鮑信回郡募兵，但鮑信歸來途中何進就遇害，返至洛陽時董卓亦已進京。鮑信認為董卓是個禍患，力勸袁绍先發制人，但袁绍未採取行動，遂返回故鄉，聚集了兩萬兵、七百騎和大批輜重。初平元年（190年），關東諸郡發動董卓討伐戰，鮑信與弟鮑韜亦起兵響應，於是獲表行破虜將軍。獲推為盟主的袁紹是當時眾勢力中最強盛的，很多人都去他那處，但鮑信那時卻認為曹操才是那個將天下撥亂反正的英雄，故此與曹操交結，曹操亦親待他。後來鮑信和曹操軍在汴水之戰中敗予董卓軍，鮑韜戰死，鲍信也负伤。其時袁紹卻不積極討伐董卓，反而卻從韓馥手中奪取冀州，鮑信遂勸戒曹操經營河南，靜觀其變。初平二年（191年），袁紹表曹操為東郡太守，曹操也表鮑信為濟北相。 初平三年（192年），青州黃巾進入兗州，兗州刺史劉岱不聽鮑信所勸貿然出戰，兵敗戰死，鮑信與州吏萬潛遂迎曹操為兗州牧。鮑信與曹操先到壽張東視察戰場時，遭到黃巾襲擊，當時後軍未趕上，鮑信雖然奮力抗擊但戰死，不過卻讓曹操得以突圍而退。接著曹操重整旗鼓，但遍尋不著鮑信屍體，於是曹操令人用木頭雕刻成鮑信人像，並親自祭奠，痛哭。接著就向青州黃巾發動進攻，屢敗黃巾，並追擊至濟北，逼令黃巾歸降。曹操遂於其年冬天收編了青州黃巾的精銳為「青州兵」。鮑信死時四十一歲，為人儉樸又厚賞將士，故此死後家無餘財。曹操後在建安十七年（212年）追記鮑信功績，賜封其子鮑邵為新都亭侯，並辟命另一兒子鮑勳為丞相府掾屬。部將于禁後來也成為曹操的大將。 在嘉靖本《三國演義》字允誠 ，在諸侯討伐董卓時，鮑信想在孫堅之前先奪得戰功，派弟弟鮑忠率步騎三千，逕抄小路來到汜水關挑戰，卻被華雄所殺，之後同正史隨曹操討伐黃巾時戰死。 [在维基数据编辑],"A man from a distant province, born in a bygone era, was a descendant of a notable family. Initially serving in a minor military role, he rose to become a prominent general and regional leader. He had two sons. During the reign of a certain emperor, he was tasked with recruiting soldiers but returned to find his superior had been killed and a new power had taken control of the capital. He viewed this new leader as a threat and advised another influential figure to act, but his advice was ignored. He then returned home, gathering a substantial force.

In a year marked by conflict, regional leaders launched a campaign against the new power, and he joined the cause, earning a military title. Although many aligned with a powerful leader, he believed another rising figure was destined to restore order, forming an alliance with him. This alliance faced defeat in a significant battle, resulting in the death of his brother and his own injury. The powerful leader, however, focused on consolidating power elsewhere, prompting him to advise his ally to focus on a different region.

The following year, his ally was appointed to a regional leadership position and reciprocated by appointing him to a similar role. In the next year, a rebellion erupted, and a regional governor ignored his counsel, leading to defeat and death. He and another official then invited his ally to assume leadership of the region. While inspecting a battlefield, they were ambushed by rebels. Despite his valiant efforts, he was killed, allowing his ally to escape. His ally later regrouped and, unable to find his body, created a wooden effigy to mourn him. Subsequently, his ally launched a successful campaign against the rebels, incorporating their forces into his own.

At the time of his death, he was known for his frugality and generosity towards his soldiers, leaving his family with little wealth. Years later, his ally honored his contributions by granting titles to his sons and appointing them to positions of influence. A subordinate of his ally eventually became a prominent general. In a later retelling of these events, he was depicted as eager to achieve glory before others, sending his brother on a mission that ended in tragedy, aligning with historical accounts of his death in battle against the rebels.","The individual's story closely aligns with that of Sun Jian, a prominent figure during the late Eastern Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period in China.

郑泰,no,Cao Cao,,https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%84%AD%E6%B3%B0_(%E6%9D%B1%E6%BC%A2),鄭泰（150年？—190年？），字公業，河南開封人。東漢名儒鄭眾的曾孫，東漢官員，官至揚州刺史。鄭泰曾與荀攸等人合謀刺殺董卓但失敗。 鄭泰年輕時已有才略，漢靈帝在位末年時，鄭泰已經知道天下將會大亂，因而暗中結交豪傑，家境富裕而且有四百頃田地仍常常不夠食糧，卻名聞山東。 後來鄭泰獲舉孝廉，由三府辟命並由公车徵召，但鄭泰不應命。中平六年（189年），漢靈帝死，漢少帝劉辯繼位，並由大將軍何進輔政，何進任命鄭泰為尚書侍郎，遷待御史。同時何進密謀誅除宦官，打算召并州牧董卓入京協助。鄭泰因而對何進說：「董卓強暴殘忍，有無窮野心，若倚重他做朝政大事，將會放任他的凶暴和野心，必定會危害朝廷。你是皇帝的外戚，有輔政大權，應當堅持由自己決斷，誅除有罪的人，實在不適合以董卓作為援助。而且事情拖久了就會生變，竇武的事正是前車之鑒。」但何進不接受鄭泰的進言，仍請董卓入京，鄭泰於是棄官離去。後來亦和荀攸說：「何進不易輔助呀。」 同年，宦官知道何進的圖謀，於是將何進殺死，而及後董卓入京果然作亂，執掌朝政更廢立皇帝。鄭泰和城門校尉伍瓊、董卓長史何顒和尚書周毖被董卓任命去選拔天下名士為官。後鄭泰與伍瓊、何顒等勸董卓讓袁紹擔任渤海太守，用以籠絡他，但其實是想扶植袁紹作反董卓力量的源頭。 初平元年（190年）正月，袁紹自號車騎將軍，作為關東聯軍的盟主並起兵討伐董卓，董卓即與眾大臣會議，打算領兵對抗討伐軍。當時眾臣都不敢反對，而鄭泰擔心董卓軍隊兵多，強悍難制，於是出言反對出兵，董卓不悅，鄭泰於是再解釋反對出兵的原因實在是關東諸將根本無必要勞動大軍對付，並指出十點，包括人民安逸已久，已無戰意；董卓熟悉軍事，名振當時，足以令人懾服和關東諸將全都不是軍旅之才，對陣根本不是董卓的對手等，勸說董卓不要出大軍。董卓聽從，於是讓鄭泰為將軍，統率諸軍對抗討伐軍。及後有人向董卓說鄭泰智略過人，其實暗中與敵人合謀，給他兵馬就是讓他交給其同黨。董卓於是收回鄭泰兵權，改拜議郎。 其後，董卓見關東討伐軍兵多，感到恐懼，於是決心遷都，於三月正式將都城遷至長安。而當時天下大亂，又有飢荒，士大夫很多都不能生活，而因鄭泰有錢，每日都舉行聚會，藉此救濟了很多人。後鄭泰與荀攸和何顒等合謀暗殺董卓，但秘密洩漏，鄭泰從武關逃離長安，投奔後將軍袁術，袁術則上表鄭泰為揚州刺史。鄭泰於上任的路上去世，享年四十一歲。 [在维基数据编辑],"A man from a wealthy family, known for his intelligence and strategic mind, lived in a region of a vast empire during a time of political turmoil. As a young man, he foresaw the impending chaos and secretly allied himself with influential figures. Despite his wealth and extensive land holdings, he often faced shortages, yet his reputation spread far and wide.

He was eventually recommended for a prestigious position but initially declined. When the emperor passed away, a new ruler ascended the throne, and a powerful general took charge of the government. This general appointed the man to a high-ranking position and plotted to eliminate corrupt officials, planning to summon a notorious warlord to assist. The man warned against this, citing the warlord's ambition and potential threat to the government, but his advice was ignored, leading him to resign.

Later, the corrupt officials discovered the general's plot and assassinated him. The warlord then seized control, causing further chaos. The man, along with others, was tasked with selecting talented individuals for government roles. He and his allies secretly supported a rival leader to counter the warlord's power.

As tensions rose, the rival leader declared himself a military commander and led a coalition against the warlord. The man advised against direct military confrontation, arguing that the coalition was not a match for the warlord's forces. The warlord initially heeded this advice, appointing the man as a general. However, suspicions arose about the man's loyalty, leading to his demotion.

Fearing the growing strength of the coalition, the warlord decided to relocate the capital. Amidst widespread chaos and famine, the man used his resources to aid many in need. He later conspired with others to assassinate the warlord, but the plan was discovered. Fleeing to join another military leader, he was appointed to a regional governorship but died en route at the age of forty-one.","The individual's life story closely resembles that of Cao Cao, a prominent figure during the late Eastern Han dynasty in China.

郑泰,no,Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong),,https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%84%AD%E6%B3%B0_(%E6%98%8E%E6%9C%9D),"鄭泰（1612年—1663年），鄭芝龍的堂侄，鄭成功的堂兄，與鄭成功同為鄭氏十二世，並長期擔任戶官，管理財務及對外貿易。隆武帝曾封鄭泰為建平侯。鄭泰事件爆發後，鄭泰遭鄭經軟禁，親人投奔滿清，鄭泰自盡。 當鄭成功帶兵出征時，鄭泰經常留守根據地。例如： 1662年（永曆16年，清康熙元年），鄭成功打敗東印度公司，攻占臺灣。世子鄭經居廈門，和其弟的乳母陳昭娘私通生子，鄭成功大怒，要殺陳昭娘，鄭經卻保護了昭娘。鄭成功更怒，命洪旭等諸將殺鄭經和鄭經的母親董氏，洪旭認為此處分太過嚴重，請示鄭泰之後並未執行此令，廈門與臺灣兩岸緊張。同年，鄭成功去世，鄭襲在臺灣自立為王，後來鄭經克臺，打敗了叔父鄭襲，在台灣嗣位。 1663年（永曆17年），鄭經懷疑鄭泰和擁護叔父鄭襲的大臣黃昭有所勾結，想要整肅鄭泰的勢力。鄭經先封鄭泰為金廈總制，假意要把金門和廈門都交給鄭泰，接著鄭經請鄭泰赴宴並趁機將鄭泰軟禁起來。當晚鄭泰之弟鄭鳴駿和兒子鄭纘緒等人懼禍帶著軍艦五百艘和水手八千餘人投降清朝，鄭泰聞訊後自縊身亡。 鄭成功北伐失敗之後，鄭泰對明鄭事業失去信心，開始把資金匯到日本，以備萬一，寄存在日本長崎唐通事辦事處。（根據郭弘斌著的《台灣人的台灣史》，寄銀總共307,032兩3錢4分，亦即丁銀3,070貫323匁4分。然而《閩海紀要》所記載的這個數據是40萬）這件事鄭成功、鄭經父子都不知道。一直到鄭泰死後，鄭經派人細查帳冊才發現。 從1663年（明永曆17年、清康熙2年、日寬文3年）開始，鄭經派協理刑官蔡政到日本，向日方要求歸還這筆錢。但是鄭泰的弟弟鄭鳴駿也派人到日本要求歸還，而且還持有存銀勘合。日本受理雙方訴訟後，表示僅以雙方的提訴理由不能決定，要求雙方提出充分證據。 此後，1664、1665、1666年，鄭經和鄭泰親族都各派代表到長崎交涉。到1674年，日本決定將存銀交給鄭泰遺族。但是此時中國正發生三藩之亂，在北京的鄭泰遺族被滿人控制，行動並不能自主，想要再歸屬鄭經，於是派人前往廈門拜會鄭經，以存銀勘合為條件請降，鄭經答應。 1675年，鄭經派員往日本拿回存銀。原本的30萬兩白銀，日本扣開支銷（部分是因為1663年的一場大火燒黑或燒鎔成塊），只發回26萬。 這一項索回寄銀的事件，前後12年，鄭經方面派人交涉4次，鄭泰遺族則有6次。","A man born in the early 1600s, a relative of a prominent leader, held a significant position managing finances and trade. He was once granted a noble title by an emperor. After a certain incident, he was placed under house arrest by a family member, leading to his demise. During military campaigns, he often stayed behind to manage the base. In a particular year, a leader defeated a foreign company and took control of an island. The leader's heir, residing in a coastal city, had a scandalous affair, causing family tensions. The leader's anger led to orders for severe punishment, but these were not carried out, causing regional tensions. The leader passed away that same year, and a relative declared himself ruler on the island, only to be later defeated by the heir.

The following year, suspicions arose about the man's connections with a minister supporting the rival relative. The heir pretended to promote the man, only to detain him during a banquet. That night, the man's brother and son fled with a fleet to join another power, leading to the man's tragic end. After a failed campaign, the man lost faith in their cause and secretly transferred funds to a foreign country for safekeeping. This was unknown to the leader and his heir until after the man's death, when the heir discovered the financial records.

Starting in the mid-1600s, the heir sent an official to the foreign country to reclaim the funds. However, the man's brother also made a claim, holding a certificate for the funds. The foreign authorities required evidence from both parties. Over the next few years, representatives from both sides negotiated in the foreign city. Eventually, the foreign country decided to return the funds to the man's family. However, due to ongoing conflicts in their homeland, the family, under foreign control, sought to rejoin the heir, offering the funds as a condition. The heir agreed.

In the late 1600s, the heir sent representatives to retrieve the funds. Originally amounting to a significant sum, the foreign country deducted expenses, returning a lesser amount. This process of reclaiming the funds spanned over a decade, with multiple negotiations from both the heir's side and the man's family.","The story closely resembles the life of Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong), a Chinese military leader who played a significant role during the transition from the Ming to the Qing dynasty. Koxinga was known for his efforts to resist the Qing dynasty and his control over Taiwan. The narrative of a leader defeating a foreign company and taking control of an island aligns with Koxinga's expulsion of the Dutch from Taiwan. The family tensions and the heir's scandalous affair could relate to the internal conflicts within Koxinga's family. The financial dealings and the eventual return of funds also fit the historical context of Koxinga's interactions with foreign powers and his family's later negotiations. The timeline and events, such as the house arrest and demise, are consistent with the historical accounts of Koxinga's life and his family's subsequent actions."
丁原,no,Cao Cao,,https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%81%E5%8E%9F,丁原（140年？—189年），字建陽，東漢末年的地方豪杰之一，被董卓設計由其部將呂布刺殺。拜武猛都尉，并州刺史，官至執金吾。 丁原出身貧寒卑微，因會寫文章，年少时被任用为官吏。後為南縣吏，當有賊寇來犯時，都會身先士卒，衝出追寇。 中平五年（188年）三月，休屠各胡在并州胡地區域起兵叛亂，并州刺史張懿奉命領兵鎮壓叛亂失利兵敗身死，朝廷下詔讓善於領兵討寇的丁原接任并州刺史，上任後收編從并州北境內遷避亂的殘軍吏民，隨後轉拜騎都尉、武猛都尉，屯兵在河內郡。期間錄用以武勇聞名州里的呂布、張楊、張遼等人為麾下。 同年八月，漢靈帝頒布下達詔書至諸州郡徵募兵丁組建西園新軍，同時大將軍何進亦以府令傳達各州郡徵募兵勇，丁原接到詔令與府令後，先派遣武猛從事張楊入京謁拜上軍校尉蹇碩，張楊被蹇碩封為上軍假司馬；經由張杨探查西園軍內情得知，以袁紹為首的六名校尉（除卻蹇碩、鮑鴻）皆暗中親附何進密謀勦除宦黨，於是又遣屬下從事張遼謁拜大將軍何進，何進辟除張遼為大將軍府署兵曹掾吏。暗中與袁紹、何進聯絡密謀參與誅勦宦黨的事變行動。 中平六年（189年），漢靈帝駕崩，丁原受何進之召令，燒孟津，火照城中，帶兵到洛陽誅殺宦官，但事情被何皇后制止，轉拜為執金吾。 同年，何進被宦官密謀所殺，董卓把持朝政，為壮大自己势力，诱使呂布杀害丁原，由此董卓亦接收其士兵。 卒年推估時值昭寧元年（189年）八月二八（辛未日）至九月初一（甲戌日）間。 丁原為人雖然粗略，但有遠謀、武勇，善於騎射，打仗時都身先士卒。,"In a distant era, a local leader known for his bravery and strategic mind met a tragic end. Rising from humble beginnings, he gained recognition for his writing skills and was appointed as an official at a young age. During his service, he was known to lead from the front in battles against invaders. In a year marked by unrest, a rebellion erupted in a northern region, and the leader was tasked with quelling it after his predecessor's failure. He successfully reorganized the scattered forces and civilians, earning promotions and establishing a stronghold in a strategic area. He recruited several renowned warriors to his ranks.

Later that year, the central authority issued a decree to recruit soldiers for a new army, and the leader sent an envoy to the capital to gather intelligence. Discovering a conspiracy among high-ranking officials to eliminate a corrupt faction, he aligned himself with the plotters. The following year, after the ruler's death, he was summoned to the capital to eliminate the corrupt officials, but his plans were thwarted by a powerful figure. Subsequently, he was appointed to a prestigious position.

However, the political landscape shifted dramatically when a powerful warlord seized control and manipulated one of the leader's trusted generals to assassinate him, thereby absorbing his forces. Despite his rough demeanor, the leader was known for his foresight, bravery, and skill in battle, always leading his troops with courage.","The individual described seems to be Cao Cao, a prominent figure during the late Eastern Han dynasty in China. Known for his strategic mind and military prowess, Cao Cao rose from humble beginnings to become a key leader. He was involved in quelling rebellions and reorganizing forces, much like the description. Cao Cao was also known for his literary skills and was involved in political conspiracies and power struggles, aligning with plotters to eliminate corrupt officials. His eventual assassination by a trusted general under the influence of a rival warlord aligns with the historical accounts of his life and death."

During a particular year, he led a small group of personal guards, disguising them as sentries to guard a gate. When the warlord arrived, he attempted to strike him with a spear, but the warlord's armor deflected the blow. The warlord was injured and fell from his chariot, only to be killed by another warrior. Later, this figure was sent by the same warrior to attack another adversary but was defeated and retreated to a nearby region. Due to his failure in battle, he was executed by the warrior.","The story describes a historical figure involved in the assassination of a powerful leader during a time of political turmoil in a declining empire. The figure was a cavalry officer who attempted to kill the leader but was ultimately unsuccessful, and the leader was killed by another. This aligns with the story of Caius Cassius Longinus, who was one of the key conspirators in the assassination of Julius Caesar. Although Cassius was not the one who delivered the fatal blow, he was deeply involved in the conspiracy. The subsequent defeat and execution also fit the narrative of the aftermath of Caesar's assassination, where many conspirators faced dire consequences."
陈宫,yes,Guan Yu,"Chen Gong was a military strategist and advisor during the late Eastern Han dynasty in China, known for initially serving Cao Cao before defecting to Lü Bu.",https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%99%88%E5%AE%AB,陳宮（2世纪—199年2月7日），字公臺，兗州東郡武陽縣（位於山東省與河南省之間）人，剛直烈壯，年少與海內知名之士皆連結。東漢末年天下大亂，為曹操的麾下，後叛投到呂布帳下。為呂布出謀獻策。呂布死亡後，拒絕向曹操投降，而被曹操揮淚絞刑。 陳宮是兗州東郡武陽縣（位於山東省與河南省之間）人，年少時與海內知名之士認識，當時董卓廢劉辯為弘農王而立漢獻帝導致天下大亂時，便加入曹操義兵陣營。。小说《三國演義》則以陈宫是东汉末年中牟县县令，捕获被通缉的曹操，却弃官随其私逃。 初平三年（192年），青州的百萬黃巾军入侵了兗州，轉入東平縣。兗州刺史劉岱想要攻打黃巾黨，濟北相鮑信勸他最好固守。劉岱不聽鮑信的勸告，與黃巾黨交戰，兵敗被殺。 劉岱既死，陳宮劝說曹操：「兗州今無主，我自请去兖州游說，让他们找你做州牧。你可以凭借此处征服天下，成就霸王之業。」陳宮到了兗州后游说別駕、治中等人：「今天下分裂而兗州無主。曹操是天下的大才，若把他迎接来做州牧，必能给百姓带来太平。」鮑信等同意。鮑信乃與州吏萬潛等至東郡迎曹操領兗州牧。曹操赴任后出兵擊黃巾于壽張東面。鮑信力戰而死。曹操击败黃巾，追击残敌至濟北。受降卒三十餘萬，男女百餘萬口，收其精銳者整军，號為“青州兵”。 興平元年（194年），曹操東征徐州陶謙，使程昱與荀彧留守鄄城，其將領陳宮屯東郡。陳宮與從事中郎許汜、王楷共謀反叛曹操，陳宮說服張邈：「今天下分崩，雄桀並起，君擁十萬之眾，當四戰之地，撫劒顧眄，亦足以為人豪，而反受制，不以鄙乎！今曹操東征，其處空虛，呂布壯士，善戰無前，迎之共據兗州，觀天下形埶，俟時事變通，此亦從橫一時也。」張邈與弟張超及陳宮等迎呂布為兗州牧，據濮陽，郡縣皆應。 呂布至，張邈使劉翊告荀彧：「呂布來助曹操擊陶謙，緊需請求軍糧。」眾疑惑。荀彧知張邈為叛亂，即緊守兵馬，急召東郡太守夏侯惇，而兗州諸城皆應呂布。時曹操大軍攻陶謙，留守兵少，而諸將多與張邈、陳宮通謀。夏侯惇至，其夜誅謀叛者數十人，眾乃定。豫州刺史郭貢率眾數萬來至城下，或言與呂布同謀，眾甚懼。郭貢求見荀彧，荀彧將往。夏侯惇等曰：「君一州鎮守，往必危險，不可。」荀彧則表示：「郭貢與張邈等，分非素結也，今來速，計必未定；及其未定說之，縱不為用，可使中立，若先疑之，彼將怒而成計。」郭貢見荀彧無懼意，認為鄄城難攻而退兵。 呂布軍降者，言陳宮取東阿，又使氾嶷取范，吏民皆恐。彧謂程昱曰：「今兗州反，唯有此三城。陳宮等以重兵臨之，非有以深結其心，三城必動。君，民之望也，歸而說之，殆可！」程昱乃歸，過范，說其令靳允：「聞呂布執君母弟妻子，孝子誠不可為心！今天下大亂，英雄並起，必有命世，能息天下之亂者，此智者所詳擇也。得主者昌，失主者亡。陳宮叛迎呂布而百城皆應，似能有為，然以君觀之，布何如人哉！夫布，粗中少親，剛而無禮，匹夫之雄耳。陳宮等以勢假合，不能相君也。兵雖眾，終必無成。曹操智略不世出，殆天所授！君必固范，我守東阿，則田單之功可立也。孰與違忠從惡而母子俱亡乎？唯君詳慮之！」靳允流涕：「不敢有二心。」時氾嶷已在縣，靳允伏兵刺殺氾嶷，歸勒允兵守。程昱又遣別騎絕倉亭津，陳宮至，不得渡。程昱至東阿，東阿令棗祗已率厲吏民，拒城堅守。又兗州從事薛悌與程昱協謀，终于堅守三城，以待曹操。 曹操引軍從東還，呂布攻鄄城不能下，西屯濮陽。曹操認為：「呂布一旦得一州，不能據東平，斷亢父、泰山之道乘險要我，而屯濮陽，我知其無能。」遂進軍攻之。布出兵戰，先以騎犯青州兵。青州兵奔，曹操陣亂，馳突火出，墜馬，燒左手掌。司馬樓異扶曹操上馬，遂引去。未至營止，諸將未與曹操相見，皆恐懼。曹操親自勞軍，令軍中準備攻城器具，再次進攻，與呂布攻守百餘日。蝗蟲起，糧食缺乏，引發吃人事件，呂布糧食亦盡，各引軍去。呂布東屯山陽。 荀彧向曹操表示：「昔日劉邦保關中，劉秀據河內，皆深根固本以制天下，進足以勝敵，退足以堅守，故雖有困敗而終濟大業。將軍本以兗州首事，平山東之難，百姓無不歸心悅服。且河、濟，天下之要地也，今雖殘壞，猶易以自保，是亦將軍之關中、河內也，不可以不先定。今以破李封、薛蘭，若分兵東擊陳宮，陳宮必不敢西顧，以其閒勒兵收熟麥，約食畜穀，一舉而呂布可破也。破呂布，然後南結揚州，共討袁術，以臨淮、泗。若舍呂布而東征徐州，多留兵則不足用，少留兵則民皆保城，不得樵採。布乘虛寇暴，民心益危，唯鄄城、范、衞可全，其餘非己之有，是無兗州也。若徐州不定，將軍當安所歸乎？且陶謙雖死，徐州未易亡也。彼懲往年之敗，將懼而結親，相為表裏。今東方皆以收麥，必堅壁清野以待將軍，將軍攻之不拔，略之無獲，不出十日，則十萬之眾未戰而自困耳。前討徐州，威罰實行，其子弟念父兄之恥，必人自為守，無降心，就能破之，尚不可有也。夫事固有棄此取彼者，以大易小可也，以安易危可也，權一時之勢，不患本之不固可也。今三者莫利，願將軍熟慮之。」曹操乃止。大收麥，復與呂布戰，二年間，曹操盡復收諸城，擊破呂布于鉅野。呂布敗走東奔劉備。兗州遂平。 建安元年（196年）六月，呂布部將郝萌發動叛亂，攻擊下邳府的廳事閤，呂布驚慌中全身赤裸裸急忙和某女子突破廁所的牆壁脫逃，到都督高順的營內，高順讓出督將位子給呂布。高順詢問呂布有沒有什麼可以依靠用來判斷敵人的線索，呂布只回答聽到河內人的話，高順判斷出敵人是郝萌，並且立即帶兵進入下邳府，斬殺郝萌，平定叛亂。事件結束後，呂布詢問曹性事情的起源，曹性答：「郝萌受袁術的鼓動而造反。」呂布又問：「有誰同謀嗎？」曹性回答說陳宮就是同謀，當時陳宮就坐在呂布旁臉發紅，呂布以陳宮為大將為由並不追究，後讓曹性統領郝萌餘部。 建安三年（198年）冬，曹操軍隊圍攻下邳時，曾獻計以呂布屯兵城外，與下邳互為犄角，本來呂布答應，但呂布在妻子的建言下而不採納。三月後（十二月，199年），呂布軍心崩潰，部將侯成、魏續、宋憲叛變，縛其投降曹操。 當陳宮被縛，和曹操對話時，曹操問：「公臺你每次說你自己智計有餘，現在如何？」陳宮直指呂布：「就是這個人不聽我諫言才會有這下場，若聽我的，就不至於被捉了。」曹操一度勸他再度出仕自己，但陳宮不為所動，义正辞嚴地答道：“作為漢朝的臣子沒有報國盡忠，且作為人子沒有盡孝，理当一死。” 曹操再問起陳宮的母親、妻子及子女，陳宮以曹操的仁孝治政不會殘害家屬為由託付給曹操，並表明就死決心說：「请出就戮，以正军法。」隨即頭也不回的赴刑場就義而死，曹操泣而送之。陳宮與高順、呂布一起被縊殺，老母妻小一家由曹操所供養，侍從若有怠慢者，即斬殺之，陳宮女兒的婚事也為曹操安排。,"A man from a region between two provinces, known for his integrity and strength, was connected with many renowned individuals in his youth. During a period of great turmoil, he initially served under a powerful leader but later defected to join another warlord, offering strategic advice. After the warlord's death, he refused to surrender to his former leader and was executed. In his early years, he was acquainted with many notable figures and joined a militia during a time of chaos. In a fictional account, he is depicted as a county magistrate who captured a wanted man but chose to flee with him instead.

In a certain year, a massive army invaded a region, prompting a local official to advise against direct confrontation. Ignoring this advice led to a disastrous defeat. After the official's death, the man persuaded his leader to take control of the region, promising that it would serve as a base to conquer the land. He successfully convinced local officials to support this plan, and the leader was welcomed to govern the area. The leader then launched a campaign against the invading army, achieving significant victories and incorporating many of the enemy's forces into his own.

In another year, the leader embarked on an eastern campaign, leaving the man and others to guard a city. The man conspired with others to rebel, convincing a local leader to join forces with a formidable warrior to seize control of the region. The warrior was welcomed as the new governor, and many localities supported him. However, the leader's forces managed to hold key cities, and a strategic withdrawal by the warrior's forces followed.

The leader's advisor suggested a strategy of consolidating power in a key region, arguing that it would provide a strong base for future operations. The leader heeded this advice, focusing on securing resources and preparing for further conflict. Over the next two years, the leader regained control of the region and defeated the warrior, who fled to another ally.

In a later year, a rebellion erupted within the warrior's ranks, but it was swiftly quelled. The warrior's forces eventually succumbed to internal strife, leading to his capture and execution. The man, when captured, refused to serve his former leader again, choosing instead to face execution with dignity. His family was cared for by his former leader, who ensured their well-being and arranged a marriage for his daughter.","The individual's story closely aligns with that of Guan Yu, a famous general from the Three Kingdoms period in China. Known for his loyalty and integrity, Guan Yu initially served under the warlord Liu Bei. He was captured by Cao Cao but later rejoined Liu Bei. His refusal to serve Cao Cao again and his execution are well-documented. The fictional account of him as a county magistrate who captures and then flees with a wanted man is reminiscent of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, where Guan Yu is depicted as a paragon of loyalty and righteousness. His connection with many notable figures and his strategic role in military campaigns further support this identification."
法正,yes,Zhuge Liang,"Fa Zheng was a strategist and advisor during the Three Kingdoms period in China, serving under the warlord Liu Bei.",https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B3%95%E6%AD%A3,法正（176年—220年），字孝直。東漢司隸右扶風郿（今陕西眉县）人，三國時蜀漢重臣；深有謀略，定軍山之戰策劃襲殺夏侯淵。劉備在世時，惟獨法正有諡號，死後追諡為翼侯。與曹魏謀士程昱和郭嘉一樣有性格缺陷（程昱太剛直易得罪人、郭嘉行為不檢、法正則是睚眥必報），但同樣善策奇謀，故陳壽譽其可比二人。 法正出生于176年，他的祖父法真為當代名士。其家族為戰國時代田齊君主齊襄王田法章的後人。 建安初年，天下饥荒，法正与同郡孟达一同入蜀依附刘璋，多年後法正升為新都令，后召署军议校尉。但法正不受劉璋重用，又為其州邑僑客之人所诽谤，非常不得志。 益州别驾张松与法正相為友善，深覺劉璋不足以有所作為，常暗自歎息，無法施展才能。 建安十三年（208年），张松於荊州出使見曹操归来，勸說劉璋與曹操斷絕關係，而與劉備交好結盟。劉璋問：「誰可以作為使者？」張松乃舉薦法正，原本法正辭讓不願前往，因張松再三舉薦才前往。法正出使回來後，向張松說劉备有雄才大略，是值得效命的英主，於是兩人秘密達成奉戴劉備的共識，期望有朝一日能迎劉備入川蜀。 建安十六年（211年），劉璋聽聞曹操有滅漢中張魯之意而常懷畏懼之心，張松乘機勸劉璋應當恭迎邀請劉備入川蜀，讓劉備分擔抵禦張魯的責任，劉璋再次派遣法正為正使，與孟達為副使，率領四千人受命前往荊州。法正表面宣告來意，暗地里向劉備献策：「以將軍之命世英才，乘劉璋之懦弱无能；張松，益州裡的股肱人才，以为内应；然後以益州之殷富，凭天府之險阻，以此来成大业，易如反掌。」诸葛亮的三分天下之计须取荆州和益州二地，法正、张松倒戈实乃天赐良机。劉備聽從了法正的計策，領兵沿長江逆流而上，西進與劉璋相會於涪城。 建安十七年（212年），隨後劉備率軍北上葭萌，接著又率軍掉頭南返進攻劉璋。刘璋的部下谋士郑度向劉璋點出劉備軍糧草不足的問題以坚壁清野之策拖垮劉備，並进谏：「劉備領孤軍遠道而來進攻，百姓尚未向歸附劉備，全靠臨時徵集民間的糧草，軍隊嚴重缺乏物資輜重。對付他們最好的計策是把巴西、梓潼兩地的百姓全部驅趕遷往至涪水以西，把兩地農田裡、糧倉裡的糧草全部燒毀，我軍沿河岸修築城防深挖濠溝，鎮靜地等待他們的到來。他們來後，向我們挑戰，我們堅守不出，時間久了他們就會出現糧草供給不上的問題，不出百日，必定自行撤退。劉備軍一旦撤退，我軍進攻追擊，這樣即可生擒劉備。」劉備聽到消息後憂慮甚為忿恨，詢問法正如何應對。法正說：「劉璋不會採用鄭度的計策，不用擔心。」結果如法正所言，劉璋答：「我只聽說抗擊敵人保護百姓，從未聽說遷徙百姓來躲避敵人。」而拒絕鄭度這條計策，並將郑度免職。 建安十八年（213年），劉備進攻到雒城，派人召荊州兵馬諸葛亮、張飛、趙雲、劉封等人入蜀支援，法正去信給劉璋說：「法正我禀性缺乏才智，現在您與左將軍友好結盟受到損害，我擔心您身旁的人不明事情的來龍去脈，必定會把所有過錯都歸咎到我一人身上，使我終生蒙受恥辱，也使您連帶受辱，故而失身流落在外，不敢回去複命。怕您厭惡我的言語聲音，所以這期間也不敢向您寫信致意。回想起往日您對我的恩情，我常常翹首西望，心中極為悲傷惆悵；然而我考慮還是把事情的前因後果說清楚以披露自己的心跡。從事情的初始直到最終，我絕沒有隱瞞任何真情，有言不盡意表白不清之處，是我愚笨拙劣，誠意沒能將您打動，以致造成今天這種局面。現在國事危急，大禍臨頭，雖然我流落在外，張口就會增加您對我的怨恨，我覺得還是應該把心中要說的話說出來，以剖明自己的忠心。 將軍你的本心，我法正是了解的，實際是謹慎小心不願得罪左將軍，而最終還是引起矛盾，是因為您身邊的人不明白英雄處世從事的道理，以為可以違背信義誓約，憑著意氣辦事。他們長期以來，追求順耳悅目，阿諛奉承趨炎附勢，皆因他們缺乏遠慮不為國家作長遠打算。事變發生以後，他們又不能估量雙方勢力的強弱形勢，以為左將軍孤軍遠道而入，缺乏糧草儲備，故想以多擊少，曠日相持。而左將軍自白水關到此，所過郡縣全被攻破，將軍您所有的關口、營寨，日益孤立衰落。雒城雖有兵馬上萬，但都是敗陣之卒、破軍之將，如果打算憑此軍隊爭一時戰鬥的勝利，那麼兵將勢力確實不相當；打算長期相持來消耗左將軍的糧草也行不通，因為左將軍的營地已扎守堅固，糧草已有了積囤，而將軍您的地盤日益漸少，百姓日益困窮，敵對力量越來越多，軍需供應又被遠遠隔開。以臣愚見，真正糧草先竭、無法堅持長久的卻是將軍。照目前兩邊情況相持下去，將軍實難維持。現在張益德率領數万之眾，已平定巴東，進入犍為境界，並分兵平定江陽、德陽，安漢三路向前挺進，您如何抵擋得住？原來替將軍謀劃的人，肯定說左將軍是孤軍遠來而缺乏糧草，運送不及，而且兵少無援。如今荊州入蜀的道路已被開通，左將軍的軍隊比原來增強幾十倍，還有孫權將軍已派遣他的弟弟及李異、甘寧等領兵做後援。比較主客雙方的形勢變化，如果您想憑土地廣大來取勝，而今對方已完全佔領了巴東，廣漢、犍為也大半被攻占，巴西又非將軍所有了。計算起來益州所能憑依的只有蜀郡，而蜀郡已經不復完整，川蜀土地已三分失二，官吏百姓已疲憊不堪，每十戶人家就有八戶企圖起來作亂。如果敵軍離得遠則百姓忍受不了長久的勞役，敵軍進逼近則他們就會投降反叛。廣漢各郡縣就是明證。 此外魚腹（今重慶市永安鎮奉節縣）與白水關（今廣元市青川縣營盤鄉五里埡），一是東沿水路長江取魚腹（奉節）可入蜀，二是北從陸路取（關頭）白水關亦可入蜀。因而守住魚腹、關頭是福，失掉魚腹、關頭必然有禍。實在是決定益州禍福成敗的門戶，如今兩道門戶已被打開，堅固的城池皆被攻破，各路軍隊都被擊敗，能戰的兵將已損失殆盡，而敵軍幾路進擊，已攻入益州的心腹之地，而您僅能困守成都、雒城二地，誰存誰亡的局勢，昭然可見。這只是大致情形，比較明顯易見，至於其餘曲折隱伏的因素，就難以用文字表述清楚了。像我法正這種下愚之人，尚且明白如此局面再難扭轉，何況將軍您身旁聰明多智的謀士，豈能不明白事情的必然後果？他們靠暫時的苟且僥倖，乞求容身，獻媚邀寵，不作長久打算，不肯盡心獻上良策。如果事情危急大勢已去，他們將各自謀生逃命，保全自家門戶，調身轉背，就會作出與現在完全不同的打算，絕不會為將軍您盡忠死節，反過來您的家口還會受到他們帶來的憂患。我法正雖已蒙受不忠的誹謗，但捫心自問我並未有負于您的恩德，顧念我們之間的君臣名分義務，我實在為將軍疾首痛心。左將軍為了國家的根本利益而舉兵前來，對您的舊情依在，並無敵意，我竊以為您可以根據事情的變化而改變策略，以便保全自己的家族。」 建安十九年（214年），刘备军包围成都，蜀郡太守许靖欲棄城逃亡。事情敗露並未成功。劉璋因成都即將陷落，故沒有處決許靖。劉璋投降後，劉備因許靖背主之事而看不起許靖，對他不加任用。法正勸劉備說：「天下有的是博得虛名而無真正德才之人，像許靖即是如此。但是主公大業方興，許靖的名聲是四海之內皆知，如果對他不能待之以禮，天下之人則會因此說主公在輕賢慢士。所以對許靖應該敬重以待，以此昭示遠近，您是在追效戰國燕昭王厚待郭隗的作法。」於是劉備起用許靖，派任許靖官位高但無實權的職務。 攻下成都後，劉備佔據益州後便領益州牧，从此奠定了三国鼎立的基础。眼下當務之急是需與蜀中豪強結納關係，因此群臣勸劉備迎娶劉璋舊將吳懿之妹穆皇后吳氏，但吳氏是劉璋已故兄長劉瑁之妻，劉備認為自己與劉瑁同族，這麼做有違禮法。法正進諫道：「論其親疏，何與晉文之於子圉乎？」晉文公逃難到秦國時曾娶了親侄晉懷公子圉的妻子懷嬴。法正認為晉文公尚且可以娶親侄之妻而未遭到禮法的抨擊，何況於劉備與劉瑁之間還不是親戚關係。劉備遂納吳氏為夫人。其後，劉備賜予諸葛亮、法正、張飛及關羽四人黃金各五百斤，白銀千斤，錢五千萬，錦千匹，作為諸將中最高賞賜。法正被任命為蜀郡太守、揚武將軍。 建安十九年（214年），劉備命揚武將軍法正與軍師將軍諸葛亮、昭文將軍伊籍、左將軍西曹掾劉巴、興業將軍李嚴五人一起制定「以法治蜀」之律法《蜀科》。改變劉璋治下益州法紀鬆弛，德政不舉，威刑不肅的局面。然而法正雖然擅長軍事謀略，但在政治政見上稍差，但知因循守舊卻不會變通。《蜀科》制定後，由於嚴法治蜀，打擊了地方豪強勢力，豪強十分不滿，以消極態度牴觸蜀漢政權，為此，法正提出用當年漢高祖入關與民約法三章之事向諸葛亮進言，認為成都初定，宜緩刑弛禁，放寬約束。但諸葛亮認為不能盲目沿用漢初的法度，應當因時制宜，懂得變通，於是寫了封信《答法正書》給法正，曉以大義，告訴其更深一層的意思。 當時法正得勢，在外掌握著益州首府蜀郡的行政大權（蜀郡下轄成都縣），同時兼任地方官和首都的行政首長；在內為劉備出謀劃策，係劉備身邊的主要謀士。 然法正性格恩怨分明、睚眥必報。尤其在掌握大權後，曾給與滴水恩情的人均給予回報；反之，即便與其僅是有過小小矛盾，亦加以報復，擅殺毀傷己者數人。於是有人向諸葛亮告發，望他能稟報劉備，勿讓法正作威作福。然而諸葛亮深知法正乃深得寵信的肱股之臣，且勞苦功高，遂不上報。 建安二十年（215年），孫權知道劉備已奪得益州，希望取回荊州。劉備卻推託說：「當得到涼州時，便會把荊州給予。」孫權對此十分怨恨，便派呂蒙奪取長沙、零陵、桂陽三郡。鲁肃将万余人马于益阳牵制关羽，刘备从益州带兵回援。当时随从的军师为法正，后曹操南攻汉中，威慑蜀中，刘备便迅速和孙权修和，协议平分荆州，湘江以西的三郡南郡、零陵、武陵歸劉備，湘江以東的三郡江夏、桂陽、長沙則歸孫權，但双方关系已趋恶化。 建安二十二年（217年），法正認為曹操降伏張魯後卻未繼續進攻益州，反而留下夏侯淵、張郃駐守漢中，一定是內部動亂，眼下正是奪取漢中的最佳時機。 且告訴劉備奪取漢中的意義： 與曹軍在漢中作戰時形勢不利，本應馬上撤退，而劉備不肯，無人敢進諫。當時箭如雨下，法正見狀便站到劉備前面當肉盾擋箭，劉備急忙說：「法正快去避箭！」法正回：「連主公也甘冒箭雨身先士卒，何況我呢。」劉備只好下令撤退。 建安二十四年（219年），正月，劉備南渡沔水，於定軍山、興勢山山麓紮營，與率軍前來的夏侯渊部對峙。當時夏侯渊駐守南線據點走馬谷，張郃駐守東線據點廣石。法正採取聲東擊西之計，讓劉備將萬餘精兵分作十隊，趁夜輪番進攻廣石。張郃率親兵搏戰，雖然沒有丟失據點，但也抵擋不住劉備軍的輪番攻擊，於是向夏侯淵要求增援。夏侯淵將精兵分撥一半去支援張郃，自己繼續固守南線。隨後劉備派兵偷襲走馬谷，放火燒毀了曹軍陣地前的防衛工事鹿角，夏侯淵親自率四百軍士出營救火、修補鹿角。此時，法正看準時機，見夏侯淵正處於劣勢，提議全力進攻夏侯淵，劉備於是命黃忠居高山上奇襲臨下從後方擂鼓突襲，夏侯淵措手不及被黃忠斬殺，趙雲接應黃忠，將黃忠救出，曹軍潰敗。劉備從此奠定了漢中之戰的主動權。不久，曹操親臨戰綫，聽聞是法正獻計取漢中，因而感慨不已歎道：“吾故知玄德不辩有此，必為人所教也”，而後又說“天下賢士都被我所用，為何獨缺法正？”。接下來的漢中爭奪戰中，曹操雖然兵力佔有絕對優勢，但是劉備斂眾拒險，終不與曹操交鋒，曹操積月不拔，亡者日多。夏，曹操不得已而引軍北還，劉備遂領有漢中，效仿高祖漢王劉邦，劉備佔有漢中進位為漢中王，以法正為尚書令、護軍將軍。 在法正等人的輔佐下，劉備集團西取巴蜀、北收漢中，劉備進位漢中王，達到了勢力的頂峰。諸葛亮對此評價：“主公之在公安也，北畏曹公之強，東憚孫權之逼，近則懼孫夫人生變於肘腋之下；當斯之時，進退狼跋，法孝直為之輔翼，令翻然翱翔，不可復制。”翌年，即漢獻帝建安二十五年，建安二十四年十二月（已是公曆220年）關羽敗走麥城後，法正去世，享年45歲。劉備為他連日哭泣，諡號翼侯，讚譽法正生前深謀遠慮。賜關內侯給其子法邈，法邈的最高職位為至奉車都尉、漢陽太守。 劉備一稱帝便東征孫權欲奪回荊州、為關羽報仇，群臣大多進諫，皆不聽從。章武二年，大軍戰敗，退回白帝城。諸葛亮感歎：「倘若法孝直還活著，便能夠制止主上，使之不行東征；就算無法阻止主上，也不致於大敗而歸呀。」 法正深信「士為知己者死」，對於欣賞自己才華的主君劉備極為忠心，甚至不惜以身體為劉備阻擋箭雨，使劉備安然撤退。法正病逝後，劉備為他連日哭泣，數日間食不下嚥。 法正個性恩怨分明，得勢之後就算是請吃一餐的小恩也必報答，但對小小得罪或輕視自己的人也必施罪。 生平事迹与正史大体相当，是贤士法真孙子，张松之友。原为刘璋部属，与张松、孟达合谋献益州给刘备。在涪城大会上，与庞统一起策划刺杀刘璋的计划。伐蜀成功后，曾与诸葛亮讨论治法之事。后来任蜀郡太守时公报私仇，听闻诸葛亮向他人的解释后有所收敛。曹刘争汉中时，说服刘备亲征，又受诸葛亮之命助黄忠斩杀夏侯渊。刘备进位汉中王後，法正獲任命为尚书令。 [在维基数据编辑],"A strategist from the late period of a declining empire, known for his cunning and strategic mind, played a crucial role in a significant battle by orchestrating a surprise attack. During his lifetime, he was the only one to receive a posthumous title from his leader, who valued his counsel highly. Despite his strategic brilliance, he was known for his personal vendettas, similar to other strategists of the time who had their own character flaws. Born in a year long past, he hailed from a family with a notable ancestor from an ancient kingdom. During a time of famine, he and a companion sought refuge in a distant region under a local ruler, where he eventually rose to a position of authority. However, he was not favored by the ruler and faced slander from others, leading to his dissatisfaction.

A friend and fellow official, who shared his frustrations with the ruler's lack of ambition, often lamented their inability to showcase their talents. In a particular year, the friend returned from a diplomatic mission and advised the ruler to sever ties with a powerful warlord and instead ally with a rising leader. The ruler asked for a suitable envoy, and the friend recommended the strategist, who initially declined but eventually accepted after repeated persuasion. Upon returning, the strategist spoke highly of the rising leader's capabilities, and the two secretly agreed to support him, hoping to one day welcome him into their region.

A few years later, the ruler, fearing an attack from the powerful warlord, was persuaded by the friend to invite the rising leader to help defend against a mutual threat. The strategist was sent as the main envoy, accompanied by his companion, leading a contingent of troops. While publicly stating their mission, the strategist secretly advised the rising leader on how to exploit the ruler's weaknesses and seize control of the prosperous region. The rising leader followed this advice, leading his forces upriver to meet the ruler.

The following year, the rising leader advanced north, then turned south to attack the ruler. A local advisor pointed out the rising leader's logistical challenges and suggested a strategy to weaken him by denying resources. However, the ruler rejected this plan, believing in protecting the people rather than relocating them. The strategist assured the rising leader that the ruler would not adopt the advisor's strategy, and events unfolded as predicted.

In the subsequent year, the rising leader besieged a key city and summoned reinforcements from his home territory. The strategist wrote to the ruler, explaining his position and urging a change in strategy to preserve the ruler's family. The strategist's letter outlined the dire situation and the need for the ruler to adapt to the changing circumstances.

Eventually, the rising leader's forces surrounded the capital, and a local official's attempt to flee was thwarted. The ruler, facing imminent defeat, surrendered. The rising leader, initially dismissive of the official's betrayal, was persuaded by the strategist to treat him with respect to maintain appearances. The rising leader then appointed the official to a high-ranking but powerless position.

After securing the region, the rising leader focused on consolidating power and forming alliances with local elites. He was advised to marry a prominent widow to strengthen ties, despite initial reservations about propriety. The strategist argued that historical precedents justified the marriage, and the rising leader agreed. The strategist was rewarded with significant wealth and appointed to a high-ranking position.

In the years that followed, the strategist played a key role in drafting new laws to govern the region, addressing the previous administration's lax enforcement. Although skilled in military strategy, the strategist was less adept at political matters and advocated for leniency in law enforcement. However, a fellow advisor argued for a more adaptable approach, leading to a compromise.

The strategist, known for his clear sense of loyalty and retribution, rewarded those who had shown him kindness and retaliated against those who had wronged him. Despite complaints about his behavior, his contributions to the rising leader's success were recognized, and he remained in favor.

As tensions rose with a neighboring power, the strategist advised the rising leader on the strategic importance of a contested region. During a critical battle, he demonstrated his loyalty by shielding the rising leader from danger, earning his trust and respect.

In the final years of his life, the strategist's counsel helped the rising leader achieve significant territorial gains, reaching the peak of his power. However, after the strategist's death, the rising leader faced challenges without his guidance, leading to a costly military campaign. The strategist's loyalty and strategic acumen were remembered fondly by his leader, who mourned his passing deeply.","The individual described in the summary closely resembles Zhuge Liang, a renowned strategist from the Three Kingdoms period in China. Zhuge Liang was known for his strategic brilliance and played a crucial role in the success of Liu Bei, the rising leader in the story. He was instrumental in orchestrating surprise attacks and advising on military and political strategies. Zhuge Liang was also known for his loyalty and was highly valued by Liu Bei, who mourned his passing deeply. The posthumous title and the strategic maneuvers described align with Zhuge Liang's historical actions and contributions."
孟达,no,Meng Da,,https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%AD%9F%E9%81%94,孟達（？—228年），字子敬，为避刘备叔父讳而改为子度，東漢司隶右扶风平陵人，漢末三国时期人物。 劉備入蜀时，刘璋派遣孟达和法正去迎接刘备，刘备命其驻守江陵，蜀平后为宜都太守。建安二十四年（219年），孟达从秭归北攻房陵，殺死房陵太守蒯祺（诸葛亮的姐夫），攻下房陵后继续进攻上庸，并和刘封会合于此地。关羽围樊城、襄阳时（樊城之戰），曾要求刘封和孟达派兵援助，但被刘封和孟达拒绝，关羽战败后，孟达因畏惧被治罪，再加上跟刘封不和，于是帶著部下郤揖投降曹魏。 孟达投降曹魏后，在曹丕时受到重用，为散骑常侍、建武将军，封平阳亭侯，曹丕还将房陵、上庸、西城三郡合为新城，命其擔任新城太守，委以西南之任，孟达且与桓阶和夏侯尚亲善，并曾与夏侯尚和徐晃一同攻打刘封。 曹丕死後，当时桓阶、夏侯尚都已去世，孟达因心不自安，在诸葛亮引诱下，企图歸蜀漢，孟达又与魏兴太守申仪有隙。诸葛亮为促使孟达起事，派郭模诈降，故意将孟达之事告诉申仪。司馬懿得申仪报信后，寫信安撫孟達，暗中遣軍進討。孟達得知事泄后本已决定起事，但因得司马懿信遲疑，又認為司馬氏率軍來討必定先启奏魏帝曹叡再作定夺，至少需要三十日方能抵達，自己届时城池必已坚固；然而當司馬懿不等魏帝命令就于八日內行軍一千二百里趕來時，完全打亂孟達的部署。後來司馬懿在十六日內破上庸，斬殺孟達（详见新城之乱）。 同时代，曹魏有個举荐涿郡太守王雄的安定太守孟达，从履历看與此孟达並不是同一人。 字子庆。諸葛亮發動第一次北伐時，身處魏國上庸的孟達意圖回歸蜀國，徐晃乃做為司馬懿的副將跟隨征討孟達，在城前叫陣時被孟達一箭射中額頭，回營後不治身死。 [在维基数据编辑],"Meng Da (?-228), styled Zijing, later changed to Ziduo, was a figure from the late Eastern Han and Three Kingdoms period. When Liu Bei entered Shu, Liu Zhang sent Meng Da and Fa Zheng to welcome him. Liu Bei stationed Meng Da in Jiangling, and after Shu was pacified, he became the governor of Yidu. In the 24th year of Jian'an (219), Meng Da attacked Fangling from Zigui, killing the governor Kuai Qi, and continued to advance to Shangyong, where he joined forces with Liu Feng. During the siege of Fancheng and Xiangyang, Guan Yu requested reinforcements from Liu Feng and Meng Da, but they refused. After Guan Yu's defeat, Meng Da, fearing punishment and having conflicts with Liu Feng, defected to Cao Wei with his subordinates. 

After defecting, Meng Da was valued by Cao Pi, becoming a Cavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary and General of the Establishment of Martial Might, and was granted the title of Marquis of Pingyang Pavilion. Cao Pi merged the three commanderies of Fangling, Shangyong, and Xicheng into a new city, appointing Meng Da as its governor, entrusting him with the southwest. Meng Da was on good terms with Huan Jie and Xiahou Shang and once attacked Liu Feng with Xiahou Shang and Xu Huang. 

After Cao Pi's death, with Huan Jie and Xiahou Shang also deceased, Meng Da felt uneasy. Under Zhuge Liang's persuasion, he planned to return to Shu Han and had conflicts with Shen Yi, the governor of Weixing. To incite Meng Da to action, Zhuge Liang sent Guo Mo to feign surrender and deliberately informed Shen Yi of Meng Da's plans. Sima Yi, upon receiving Shen Yi's report, wrote to appease Meng Da while secretly dispatching troops. Upon learning of the leak, Meng Da initially decided to act but hesitated after receiving Sima Yi's letter, believing that Sima Yi would first report to the Wei Emperor Cao Rui before making a decision, which would take at least thirty days, by which time his city would be fortified. However, Sima Yi, without waiting for the emperor's orders, marched 1,200 li in eight days, completely disrupting Meng Da's plans. Sima Yi later captured Shangyong in sixteen days and executed Meng Da (see the Rebellion of the New City for details).

During the same period, there was another Meng Da in Cao Wei, the governor of Anding, who recommended Wang Xiong as the governor of Zhuo Commandery. Based on their records, they were not the same person. Styled Ziqing, during Zhuge Liang's first Northern Expedition, Meng Da, stationed in Wei's Shangyong, intended to return to Shu. Xu Huang, serving as Sima Yi's deputy, followed to suppress Meng Da and was shot in the forehead by Meng Da during a confrontation, dying from his injuries after returning to camp.","The individual described is Meng Da, a historical figure from the Three Kingdoms period of China. The narrative details his initial allegiance to Liu Bei, his defection to Cao Wei, and his eventual downfall due to his failed rebellion against Sima Yi. These events are characteristic of Meng Da's life, as he is known for his shifting loyalties and his involvement in the political and military intrigues of the time. The mention of his execution by Sima Yi after a rapid military campaign further solidifies this identification, as it is a well-documented episode in the history of the Three Kingdoms."
夏侯霸,yes,Cao Cao,"Xiahou Ba was a general of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period of China, who later defected to the rival state of Shu Han.",https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%8F%E4%BE%AF%E9%9C%B8,夏侯霸（188年前—259年或262年），字仲权，沛國譙縣（今安徽省亳州市）人；三国時期曹魏和蜀汉後期重要將領；曹魏將領夏侯渊次子，其母为曹操妻室丁氏的妹妹。司马懿發動高平陵之变后，夏侯霸投奔蜀汉，官至車騎將軍。曾隨姜維北伐，夏侯霸病逝后獲追諡，但諡號失考。 219年，夏侯霸的父亲夏侯渊拜征西将军镇守汉中，但在定军山之战与蜀汉军队交战时阵亡，夏侯霸經常誓要征討蜀漢報仇。 黄初年间（220年至226年），夏侯霸在曹魏官至偏將軍，封關內侯。 230年，魏國大舉伐蜀漢，曹真入子午道，招夏侯霸為先鋒。夏侯霸率军前進至興勢。蜀漢派兵攻打，夏侯霸亲自在阵前作战，直到获援軍救解。239年，魏明帝曹叡托孤于曹爽和司马懿，夏侯霸受到曹爽重用，後被任命为讨蜀护军、右将军，进封博昌亭侯。 247年，魏國的隴西、南安、金城、西平等地的羌人首領餓何、燒戈、伐同、蛾遮塞等相繼反叛，攻城圍邑，亦引來蜀漢方面姜維發動的北伐，涼州胡人首领治無戴也呼應反叛。夏侯霸当时督诸军屯兵於為翅，雍州刺史、前将军郭淮料定姜维必然攻打夏侯霸，于是先进兵沨中再转向南。姜維也恰如郭淮所料率軍攻打為翅的夏侯霸所部，正逢郭淮军到接应，姜維于是撤退。 249年，司马懿發動高平陵之变，斬殺执掌魏国大权的曹爽，曹爽的外弟、夏侯霸之侄征西将军夏侯玄从前线被調離，郭淮成為征西將軍；由於夏侯霸见到夏侯氏及曹家亲族被司马懿迫害而心不自安，加上他一直與郭淮不和，為了避禍遂逃入蜀汉，但在陰平迷失了道路，糧盡遇困。蜀汉得知後派人迎接。 由於早在五十年前的建安五年（200年），夏侯霸的从妹外出打柴时被张飞发现，张飞娶其为妻，生下的女儿成为了後主刘禅的皇后。因此當劉禪召见夏侯霸时宽慰他说：“你父親是死于亂軍之中，并不是由我父辈親手所殺。”又指着自己的儿子说：“这也是你夏侯氏的子侄。（张飞娶了夏侯渊的侄女--即夏侯霸的從妹夏侯氏，夏侯氏為張飛生了兩個女兒，刘禅又分別娶了張飛的兩個女兒，所以刘禅的子嗣是夏侯霸的表亲，按輩份劉禪還要叫夏侯霸為舅舅）”于是夏侯霸留在蜀汉受到重用。而夏侯霸留在曹魏的儿子因先祖夏侯渊以前的功勋受到特赦，未被追究父亲投敌之罪，但被流放到了偏远的乐浪郡（今朝鮮半島平壤）。 夏侯霸归降之后，蜀汉主将姜维问他魏国的政事，夏侯霸认为司马懿刚刚夺取政权，內部還未穩定尚无暇对外用兵，但他特别指出魏国若重用钟会將会成为蜀汉、东吴之患。 此后夏侯霸曾多次参与姜维对曹魏的战事，任至车骑将军。255年，姜維與夏侯霸出狄道，大破王經于洮西，王經退守狄道城，後陳泰派兵解圍。 《元和姓纂四校记》卷七称夏侯霸官至雍州牧，封郿侯。 夏侯霸身份特殊，同时是蜀汉、曹魏两大政權的皇族亲属，又因作為曹魏貴胄身份，在高平陵案中得罪了政變成功並在日後創立晉朝的司馬氏，故《三国志》作者陈寿基於政治考量对其记述的正文不足五十字，连其在蜀汉的封爵与谥号都没有记录。 另外，夏侯霸似乎亦有文才，在《隋書·經籍志·別集》、《新唐書·藝文志·集錄·別集類》等均有載錄「征北將軍夏侯覇集二卷」，其作品集與不少三國魏晉名士並齊。 夏侯霸到蜀地時，曾與當地名將張嶷提出交友請求，但張嶷以“不知彼此”為由而延緩，此事成為一時美談。 根据夏侯霸从妹的年龄推断，夏侯霸本人最晚出生于188年之前。《三国志·夏侯渊传》裴注引《魏略》：“初，建安五年（200年），时霸从妹年十三四，在本郡，出行樵采，为张飞所得。飞知其良家女，遂以为妻，产息女，为刘禅皇后。”古人以虚岁论，故夏侯霸这个族妹出生于186年至188年之间。 根據《三國志·蜀志·邓张宗杨传第十五》，夏侯霸的前任車騎將軍鄧芝在251年逝世，《資治通鑒》于255年時還有夏侯霸的事迹，而張翼與廖化則在259年分別擔任左右車騎將軍。另外，按照《三国志·关张马黄赵传》夏侯霸获谥在景耀三年（260年），且在后主追谥关羽、张飞等将之前。（詳見三國得諡者列表#蜀漢） 小说《三国演义》改编夏侯霸为夏侯渊的长子而非次子，因此表字「仲權」亦與「伯仲叔季」概念衝突。嘉靖本長坂坡之戰時被張飛喝死的「夏侯霸」為重名虛構人物，該角色在毛版（通行本）名為「夏侯傑」。 夏侯霸弓馬嫻熟，由曹爽推舉的心腹部將，多次抵禦蜀漢的侵擾。在征伐遼東公孫淵時，不到數回合砍掉遼東大將軍卑衍，遼東軍大亂。後來司馬懿政變，曹爽被殺，夏侯玄被調離，夏侯霸看出司馬懿的野心，遂起兵造反，打敗郭淮，在追擊逃跑的郭淮時，陳泰趕至，二人前後夾擊夏侯霸，夏侯霸兵敗，走投無路不得已降蜀，夏侯霸投蜀時已經是一個年華老去的將領。夏侯霸在蜀時追隨姜維北伐，曾提醒姜維必須提防鄧艾與鍾會兩人，姜維卻認為此兩人「量此孺子，何足道哉！」；曾不到十回合打敗郭淮救出姜維，最终卻在洮陽之戰中鄧艾伏擊被射殺。 [在维基数据编辑],"A military leader from a bygone era, born in a small village, played a significant role in the power struggles between two rival factions.

李大亮,no,Guan Yu,,https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9D%8E%E5%A4%A7%E4%BA%AE,李大亮（586年—645年1月4日），雍州京兆郡泾阳县（今陕西省咸陽市泾阳县）人，祖籍陇西郡狄道县（今甘肃省定西市临洮县），出自陇西李氏武阳房，唐朝開國功臣。被後世道教尊为神明，稱為李府千歲、李府王爺。 李大亮是北魏度支尚书李琰之的曾孙， 祖先本居于陇西郡的狄道县，世代为著名族姓，祖父李纲是西魏南岐州刺史。父亲李充节是隋朝朔州总管、武阳公。李大亮有文武才干，隋朝末年为隋将庞玉部下行军兵曹。李密率领瓦岗军攻打东都洛阳，庞玉与瓦岗军作战，兵败被俘。瓦崗軍将领张弼释放李大亮，与其结交。時任唐王的李渊兵进长安，李大亮投归輔助高祖，授士门令。劝降胡人有功，唐高祖拜李大亮為金州總管司馬，旋擢遷安州（今湖北安陆）刺史。 玄武門之變后，李淵禪讓帝位予秦王李世民。世民即唐太宗，改元貞觀。在貞觀年間，李大亮出任過交州都督、涼州都督、西北道安撫大使、劍南道巡省大使、左衛大將軍、灵州大总管、工部尚書，晉封武陽縣公。貞觀八年（公元634年）李大亮領兵征伐從吐谷渾進犯而來的番兵番將，貞觀十五年（641年）任灵州总管，与李靖协作擊敗薛延陀十万来犯之敌，受封為行軍總管。 貞觀十七年（643年），晉王李治被立為皇太子，李大亮兼任太子右衛率，又兼工部尚書，身兼三職，宿衛兩宮。李大亮每當宿值宮中，必盡忠職守、通宵假寐，太宗稱讚「有大亮宿值宮中，可通夜安臥」。梁國公房玄齡也十分器重李大亮，「每稱大亮有王陵、周勃之節，可以當大位」。 李大亮投唐以來，從金州總管晉升到行軍總管，對唐朝初年穩定政局貢獻極多。在朝中日益位高權重、聲望顯赫，但「居處卑陋，衣服儉率」，生活作風十分儉樸。尤其李大亮時刻牢記昔日張弼的救命之恩而備受稱頌。史載張弼投唐後，官至將作監丞，但生活低調、絕口不提當年，直到某一天，李大亮與張弼在路上重逢、更擁抱張弼而泣，只恨重逢太晚，並打算將大量家產送給張弼以報恩情，但張弼堅持推辭不受。日後大亮將張弼引薦御前，太宗擢升張弼為中郎將、後再升任代州都督。大亮不忘恩情，與張弼不自誇當年，兩人的經歷為當世所稱頌。 貞觀十八年（644年），唐太宗征討高句麗時，命李大亮协助房玄龄留駐长安。然而在太宗出征、途中御駕抵達洛陽休整時，便接收到李大亮病重不起的消息，太宗十分不捨，隨即親調湯藥，命專人快馬加鞭送到長安李府。而李大亮在臨終前上書太宗「請求停止征伐高句麗」，不久便去世，享壽五十九岁。 李大亮為大唐戎馬一生、功在社稷，終其一生清廉，家无余资，大亮去世時，李府家中只有米五石、布三十匹，甚是清贫。李大亮發喪時，有其在過去所濟養的親戚遺孤十五人為大亮守孝、服之如父。太宗收到李大亮訃聞後恸哭不已、甚為李大亮罷朝三日。追赠兵部尚书、秦州都督，谥懿、陪葬昭陵。舊唐書的撰書史臣讚曰：「大亮有王陵、周勃之節，名下無虛士矣！」。 台灣台南南鯤鯓代天府五府千歲大王李府千歲，據廟方沿革即為成神的李大亮。李公文武雙全，相傳與其結拜兄弟：池夢彪，吳孝寬，朱叔裕，范承業之中，李公為大哥，五人輔助唐高祖李淵、為大唐效力且立下赫赫戰功。 李公忠君愛國、體恤百姓，仙逝後，玉皇大帝敕封為代天巡狩，駐守人間，擁坐王船，巡狩四方，以驅疫除瘟，聖稱為大王李府千歲，以農曆四月二十六日為李王（大亮）的聖誕千秋。 後來在明末時期，一艘奉祀李王在內的五府千歲及其中軍府神像的王船，「遊地河」的漂流到了臺南北門南鯤鯓沙汕附近，被當地漁民奉請回鄉、建立草寮奉祀，後因神蹟顯赫、廣布流傳，當地信徒感念神恩、倡議建廟，於是在永曆十六年（1662年）修建「南鯤鯓廟」落成，即為南鯤鯓代天府的開基、與李王等五府千歲信仰在台灣的起點。 [在维基数据编辑],"A person born in the year 123 and passed away in the year 182, hailed from a region known today as the Northern Plains.

商輅,no,Zhuge Liang,,https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%95%86%E8%BC%85,商輅（1414年3月16日—1486年8月17日），字弘載，號素庵，一作素菴，谥文毅，浙江淳安人，祖籍河南開封，明朝政治人物。宣德乙卯解元，正統乙丑連中會元、狀元。官至吏部尚書、謹身殿大學士。 永樂十二年（1414年）二月二十五日出生。家贫，父祖皆不仕，祖父是獵户和樵夫，父亲在严州府衙充役小吏。商輅早年即為學諭王瑞所器重，宣德十年（1435年）舉鄉試第一，後來屢試不中，遂在太學潛心讀書十年，深受國子監祭酒李時勉賞識，于正統十年（1445年）舉會試第一，繼而殿試第一，三元及第，在明代只有被朱棣除名的黄观（黄觀為連中三元）和他有此殊榮。商輅及第后，除翰林院修撰，與劉儼等十人進學東閣。土木之變後，郕王監國，以陳循、高谷舉薦，進入內閣參贊機務。徐珵曾建議遷都，商輅則力阻。同年冬，進翰林院侍讀。 景泰元年（1450年）遣迎太上皇於居庸關，晋升學士。景泰三年（1452年）錦衣衛指揮使盧忠舉告太監阮浪、內使王瑤意圖扶植太上皇復位，明代宗大怒，逮捕兩人下詔獄。後來盧忠找同寅占卜，同寅告訴他：“這是不吉利的兆象，即使一死也無法化解。”盧忠因恐懼裝瘋。商輅進言稱其不足信，於是盧忠一併下獄，後以他罪連坐降為事官，王瑤被殺，阮浪被囚。景泰五年（1454）代宗易儲，后晋升商輅為兵部左侍郎，兼任左春坊大學士。當時河南饑荒，商輅請墾荒給糧。之後，鐘同、章綸下獄，均由商輅力救得免。《寰宇通誌》成，加兼太常寺卿。 景泰七年（1456年）代宗病重，群臣請建東宮，不予批准。商輅繼奏稱：「陛下宣宗章皇帝之子，當立章皇帝子孫。」聞者感動。因為日暮，奏未入，而同夜石亨等人已迎復上皇復位。此日，王文、于謙等被收拿，召商輅與高谷入殿，让他们起草復位詔书。石亨私下請其增加條款，遭到商輅拒絕。石亨不悅，命言官彈劾商輅，商輅於是下獄。商輅自訴《復儲疏》在禮部，可以覆驗，沒有得到回覆。當時中官興安稍微解釋，英宗更加震怒，興安則稱：「向者此輩創議南遷，不審置陛下何地。」英宗稍解，於是改釋商輅為民。後來，英宗常自言自語道：「輅，朕所取士，嘗與姚夔侍東宮」，不忍棄之。但因忌恨者多，竟不敢復用。 成化三年（1467年）明憲宗召商輅入京，恢復其內閣官職。商輅疏辭，憲宗稱：「先帝已知卿枉，其勿辭。」商輅於是進言陳勤學、納諫、儲將、防邊、省冗官、設社倉、崇先聖號、廣造士法凡八事。得到憲宗嘉獎採納，而當時羅倫、孔公恂等均恢復官職。 次年，天有彗星，给事中董旻、御史胡深等弹劾朝中不稱職的大臣，言及商輅。御史林誠詆毀其曾經參與易儲，不宜用，憲宗不聽。商輅因此求罷免，憲宗大怒，命朝廷逮捕言官，并欲加重譴。商輅則稱：“當時我曾經請陛下寬待言官，現在又指責他們，恐不公允。”憲宗欣慰，只是廷杖董旻幾人后恢復官職。之後，商輅進兵部尚書。久之，改戶部尚書。《宋元通鑒綱目》成，改兼文淵閣大學士。皇太子立，加太子少保，進吏部尚書。成化十三年（1477年）進謹身殿大學士。 商輅為人平粹簡重，寬厚有容，大事決議均毅然莫能奪。仁壽太后莊戶與民爭田，明憲宗欲徙民至塞外。商輅稱：「天子以天下為家，安用皇莊為？」此事方息。乾清宮門起火，工部請派人在四川、湖廣地區采木，商輅請少緩，得到批准。悼恭太子去世后，明憲宗因繼嗣為憂。當時紀氏生皇子朱祐樘，已經六歲，但左右內臣均畏懼萬貴妃而不敢言。之後，张敏告訴憲宗，憲宗大喜，欲宣示外廷，遣中官至內閣諭意。商輅請敕禮部擬上皇子名，於是廷臣相率稱賀。憲宗命朱祐樘見廷臣。即日后，憲宗抵文華殿，命朱祐樘侍，召見商輅及各位內閣大臣。商輅頓首請立皇太子，使得安中外心。明憲宗點頭同意。同年冬，遂立朱祐樘為皇太子。當時，憲宗召見皇子留在宮中，而其母紀氏仍在西內。商輅擔心萬貴妃加害紀氏，卻又難以直言，於是和同官上疏稱，皇子母子亦就近居住，而請紀氏遷入西六宮、永壽宮，封紀氏為妃。又過一個月，紀妃病終。商輅亦請禮宜從厚，并命司禮監奉皇子、問視、制衰服行禮。 當時，憲宗欲恢復郕王位號，命廷臣商議。商輅極言明景帝有社稷功，應當恢復位號，憲宗於是意決。憲宗還在建玉皇閣於皇宮之北，命內臣執事，禮與郊祀等，商輅則請罷免。此外，太監汪直掌管西廠，屢次製造冤案。商輅率領同官陳十一罪，與憲宗對抗。之後商輅亦說服內閣大臣萬安、劉珝、劉吉等內閣重臣，加上九卿項忠等亦彈劾汪直，當日罷黜西廠。雖然汪直不再掌管西廠，但仍然受寵，遂誣陷商輅收授指揮楊曄賄賂，而御史戴縉再次歌頌汪直功勞，請恢復西廠，商輅於是力求離去。后詔加少保，賜敕馳傳歸。商輅既去，士大夫更加俯首侍奉汪直，沒有再敢與之抗者了。 商輅為人坦蕩。錢溥曾經因為不能升遷，而作《禿婦傳》以譏諷商輅；高瑤請恢復明景帝位號，黎淳疏駁，極為詆毀商輅，商輅則均不計較，仍然待于如平日。萬貴妃重視其名，曾經遺金帛甚厚，商輅均力辭，稱：「非上命，不敢承也。」使者告訴萬貴妃，萬氏不悅，商輅此後歸鄉終不再起用。其回鄉后，劉吉路過其家，見其子孫人丁興旺，嘆道：“我劉吉與您共事多年，未曾見您筆下妄殺一人，現在是上天回報您的寬厚啊。”商輅稱：“我只是不敢讓朝廷妄殺一人而已。”十年后，成化二十二年（1486年）七月十八日卒。贈太傅，謚文毅。 商輅善書法，但傳世墨跡甚少。著有《商文毅疏稿略》、《商文毅公集》、《蔗山筆塵》，並纂有《續宋元資治通鑑綱目》二十七卷。 商輅與老師洪士直共同在學舍休憩住宿時，夢見一人提著三顆頭，並交與給他。商輅夢醒後，便把夢境中的情節告訴老師，洪說：“這是個好夢啊”後來商輅果真三元及第。 明代沈受先著有《商輅三元記》，後成為豫劇、越劇、台灣歌仔戲等各地戲曲，以及鼓曲、評彈、台灣唸歌等說唱藝術的表演題材。 [在维基数据编辑],"A person born in a small village in the early 15th century rose to prominence as a political figure in a distant empire.

刘琨,yes,Cao Cao,"Liu Kun was a Chinese military general and poet during the Western Jin dynasty, known for his efforts to defend northern China against nomadic invasions in the early 4th century.",https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%88%98%E7%90%A8,刘琨（270年—318年6月22日），字越石，中山郡魏昌县（今河北省石家庄市无极县）人，西晋末年、十六国时期政治家、文学家、音乐家、军事家，他曾经在西晋末年于晋阳（今山西太原）堅守了近十年，对抗劉淵和石勒等反晉勢力。官至司空、并州刺史、都督并冀幽三州諸軍事、侍中、太尉，封廣武侯，謚曰湣。 刘琨是西汉中山靖王刘胜之后，其祖父刘迈官至相国参军、散骑常侍，父亲刘蕃、胞兄刘舆也曾出任高官，舅舅是尚书郭奕。王敦也很欣賞刘琨。但同时他也喜好奢靡虚浮的清谈风流，是以大富豪石崇为首的“二十四友”的成员。 刘琨和祖逖一起担任司州主簿时，两人感情很好，常一起睡在同一张床上。有一天深夜，祖逖听到野鸡的叫声，把刘琨踢醒，说：“此非恶声也”。于是，两人都起床舞剑。刘琨和祖逖都有着远大的抱负，经常谈论世间事务，有时在深夜起床坐着，相互勉励：“若四海鼎沸，豪杰并起，吾与足下当相避于中原耳”。 后来，刘琨听说祖逖被东晋朝廷重用，在写给亲人故友的信中写道：“吾枕戈待旦，志枭逆虏，常恐祖生先吾着鞭”。 八王之乱中刘琨也被卷入。永康元年（300年）被其姐夫司马荂的父亲赵王司马伦重用。次年司马伦称帝，刘琨任太子詹事，辅佐司马荂。齐王司马冏、成都王司马颖、河间王司马颙等诸王讨伐司马伦。司马伦任命刘琨为冠军将军、假节。刘琨与司马伦手下孙秀领兵三万抵抗司马颖兵败。司马伦兵败之后司马冏辅政，因为刘琨出身名门，任命刘琨为尚书左丞，转司徒左长史。再次年司马冏败给东海王司马越，司马越的支持者范阳王司马虓（不是八王之一）镇守许昌，推荐刘琨为司马。 司马越派刘琨的父亲刘蕃为淮北护军、豫州刺史。河间王司马颙手下刘乔攻击司马虓，刘琨援救不及，其父母被刘乔俘获。刘琨说服其连襟溫憺的兄长冀州刺史温羡让位给司马虓。光熙元年（306年）从王浚处求得八百骑兵，战败刘乔，救出父母。刘琨助司马腾击败、斩成都王司马颖（司马颙的联军）手下大将石超，降司马颙手下荥阳守将吕朗、助司马越、司马虓连败司马颙、司马颖，被封广武侯、邑二千户。 司馬穎舊將公師藩和汲桑在北方以為司馬穎歸葬為名起兵，與張泓舊將李豐一同攻向鄴城，并州刺史司马腾最終不能抵抗、輕騎逃走、在路上被李豐殺害。三個月後苟晞才來到解救鄴城，驅走汲桑等。光熙元年（306年）九月，司马越为了扩张势力，派刘琨出任并州（今山西东部、河北西部）刺史、加振威将军、领护匈奴中郎将。在此两年前匈奴王刘渊趁八王之乱已在并州南部起兵建立“汉”政权，后改称“赵”，史称前赵。 刘琨带领一千余人辗转离开首都洛阳，永嘉元年（307年）春天到达晋阳（今山西太原）。当时的晋阳经历战乱，已成一座空城。刘琨在左右强敌环俟的环境下安抚流民，发展生产，加强防御。不到一年晋阳就恢复了生气，成了西晋在匈奴敌后的少数几个割据政权之一。 当时的晋阳西面和南面是强大的匈奴前赵，北面是正在崛起的拓跋鲜卑的代国，东面是和段部鲜卑结盟事实上独立的西晋幽州刺史王浚。刘琨和拓跋鲜卑首领拓跋猗盧结为兄弟，和前赵石勒等大将的战斗互有胜负。 永嘉四年（310年）刘琨联合拓跋猗盧讨伐依附前赵的匈奴铁弗部刘虎和白部鲜卑，胜利后上表西晋朝廷封拓跋猗盧为大单于兼代王。代郡属于幽州，所以王浚不同意，还进击拓跋猗盧被击败，从此刘琨与东邻王浚不和。 刘琨吸引了许多志愿抗击匈奴、羯人的志士，但他的政治军事才能也使不少人离去。一个叫徐润的河南人因为懂得音律得到刘琨的重用，此人无能而飞扬跋扈。奋威将军令狐盛进言要刘琨除去徐润，反被徐润诬杀，造成其子令狐泥等人的反叛，连刘琨母都知道刘琨不能成事且必然殃及自己。令狐泥投奔刘聪，具言刘琨虚实。刘聪大喜，以令狐泥为向导，正好上党太守袭醇也投降刘聪，雁门乌丸复反，刘琨亲率精兵出战，于是刘聪遣子刘粲及令狐泥于永嘉六年（312年）七月乘虚袭晋阳，太原太守高乔、并州别驾郝聿以郡投降，刘琨父母都遇害。刘琨在拓跋猗卢大军的帮助下收复晋阳。 建兴元年（313年），晋愍帝继位，封刘琨大将军、都督并州诸军事。此时石勒在晋阳的东南襄国（今河北邢台）拥兵割据，势力日盛。他修书刘琨假意降晋，出兵消灭与刘琨有矛盾的王浚，而刘琨作壁上观。 建兴三年（315年）前赵刘曜击败刘琨，但因要攻打长安回兵。刘琨被晋愍帝封为司空、都督并冀幽诸军事。刘琨辞去司空，受都督。拓跋猗卢被其儿子拓跋六修杀死。猗卢的兄弟拓跋普根殺六修平亂数月后病死，刘琨在拓跋部作为人质的儿子刘遵同箕澹等率3万余人投奔刘琨。 建兴四年（316年）石勒出兵进攻并州，刘琨不听箕澹劝阻全军尽出，中了埋伏大败，丢了并州，只身投奔鲜卑首领、晋朝幽州刺史段匹磾。同年，刘曜攻破长安，西晋結束，晋愍帝被俘。 晋愍帝被俘后，刘琨令其外甥長史溫嶠勸進琅邪王登基為帝，是為元帝。次年建武元年（317年），元帝封刘琨為侍中、太尉。 段匹磾封刘琨为大都督，率段部鲜卑的军队讨伐石勒，因石勒派人贿赂段匹磾堂弟段末杯造成段部鲜卑内部不和而流产。 太兴元年（318年），段部鲜卑内斗，段末杯击败段匹磾自任单于。段末杯俘虏了刘琨的儿子刘群并厚待他，刘群给刘琨写密信邀请他结盟共击段匹磾，被段匹磾截获。刘琨被怀疑关入大牢。次年，刘琨和段匹磾手下的几个将领企图反叛救出刘琨未遂。东晋权臣王敦派人密告段匹磾，让他杀掉刘琨。刘琨听说王敦来使，便对儿子刘遵说：“处仲（王敦）使来而不告我，是杀我也。死生有命，但恨仇耻不雪，无以下见二亲耳”。段匹磾于五月初八（6月22日）声称奉皇帝诏旨缢杀刘琨，其三个儿子和侄子、从侄二人也一起被杀。 太兴二年（319年），刘琨外甥温峤向晋元帝申冤，元帝赠谥曰愍。 握中有悬璧，本自荆山璆。 惟彼太公望，昔在渭滨叟。 邓生何感激，千里来相求。 白登幸曲逆，鸿门赖留侯。 重耳任五贤，小白相射钩。 苟能隆二伯，安问党与雠？ 中夜抚枕叹，想与数子游。 吾衰久矣夫，何其不梦周？ 谁云圣达节，知命故不忧。 宣尼悲获麟，西狩涕孔丘。 功业未及建，夕阳忽西流。 时哉不我与，去乎若云浮。 朱实陨劲风，繁英落素秋。 狭路倾华盖，骇驷摧双辀。 何意百炼刚，化为绕指柔。 刘琨精通音律，创作了《胡笳五弄》，在传统的琴曲中加入北方游牧民族的音调，描写北方历经战乱的景象，抒发了思乡爱国之情。 曾经有一次前赵匈奴围攻晋阳。刘琨登城清啸，半夜又奏胡笳（一说指挥一队士兵奏胡笳），匈奴人听到后思乡流泪，无心再战，撤兵而去。 刘琨的诗文激昂悲壮，充满对战乱中的流民的同情和抵抗敌人的决心。这种特点在他离开洛阳去晋阳途中所作的《扶风歌》中得到完整地体现。被囚后所作的《重赠卢谌》更是其代表作。此诗前半段引用了姜子牙、管仲、陈平、邓禹等人的典故，表达对晋室的忠诚。后半段描述了自己壮志未酬的心情：“何意百炼刚，化为绕指柔。”刘琨著有诗文集若干卷，已佚，今仅存诗3首，明代有人辑有《刘越石集》。 后来有很多人创作了诗作，纪念刘琨在社稷将倾之际锲而不舍的奋斗精神。譬如： [在维基数据编辑],"A prominent figure from a bygone era, born in a small village, was a multifaceted individual known for his roles as a politician, writer, musician, and military strategist during a tumultuous period.

His lineage traced back to a notable ancestor, with his family holding significant positions in the government. He was admired by many, including a powerful leader, but was also known for his indulgence in luxurious and superficial pursuits, being part of an elite social circle.

He shared a close bond with a fellow official, with whom he often discussed grand ambitions and the state of the world. During a period of political upheaval, he was drawn into conflicts, serving under various leaders and holding military commands. Despite facing numerous challenges, he managed to rescue his parents from captivity and played a crucial role in several military victories, earning him further recognition and titles.

Amidst the chaos, he formed alliances with influential leaders and engaged in battles with varying outcomes. His efforts to resist invading forces attracted many supporters, though his leadership style also led to dissent. A trusted advisor's betrayal resulted in a significant defeat, leading to the loss of his stronghold and the death of his parents. With the help of allies, he managed to reclaim his position temporarily.

As the political landscape shifted, he was appointed to high military and administrative roles, but internal conflicts and betrayals continued to plague his efforts. Eventually, he was captured and executed under dubious circumstances, leaving behind a legacy of resilience and dedication to his cause. His literary works, though mostly lost, were celebrated for their passionate and patriotic themes, inspiring future generations to commemorate his unwavering spirit in the face of adversity.","The individual's life story closely resembles that of Cao Cao, a prominent figure from the late Eastern Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period in China.

This leader, a relative of other prominent figures in his tribe, engaged in a battle against a rival nation. Despite his reputation, he was captured during this battle, leading to a defeat for his people. The rival leader, recognizing the captured leader's value, used him as a bargaining tool to negotiate peace. Before releasing him, the rival leader hosted a feast, establishing a bond akin to family ties. On his journey back home, the captured leader showed great respect towards his former captor, even in his daily actions.

Years later, after the death of the tribe's leader, a power struggle ensued. The deceased leader's successor was challenged by the captured leader, who accused the successor of plotting against him. This accusation led to a conflict, during which the captured leader seized the opportunity to eliminate his rival and claim leadership for himself. He declared himself a ruler and later took on an additional title. His reign was marked by ongoing conflicts with another relative, as they vied for control.

Eventually, the leader passed away, and his brother assumed leadership. The leader had a son and a daughter, the latter of whom became the first wife of another influential figure, later known as an empress.","The description fits Attila the Hun, a prominent leader of the Huns, known for his conflicts with the Roman Empire. The narrative of being captured and then released by a rival leader, forming a bond, and later engaging in power struggles within his tribe aligns with Attila's history. The mention of ongoing conflicts with relatives and the eventual rise to power also matches the historical accounts of Attila's life and leadership dynamics. Additionally, the reference to his daughter becoming the wife of another influential figure could relate to the alliances and marriages that were common in Attila's time to secure power and influence."
司马荂,no,Cao Cao,,https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8F%B8%E9%A6%AC%E8%8D%82,司马荂（3世纪—301年），河内郡温县（今河南省焦作市温县）人，西晋宗室，晋宣帝司马懿之孙，赵王司马伦长子。 司马荂原为散骑常侍、赵王世子。300年四月，赵王司马伦自任持节都督、都督中外诸军事，相国、侍中，模仿当年晋宣帝、晋文帝辅佐曹魏时所为。让他的长子司马荂领冗从仆射。八月，司马伦升任司馬荂为抚军将军、领军将军。301年正月初十，司马伦称帝，司马荂封为太子，以刘琨为太子詹事。 司马伦四个儿子：司馬荂浅薄鄙陋，司馬馥、司馬虔暗很强戾，司马诩愚嚚轻訬。司马荂的夫人是刘琨的姐姐、刘舆的妹妹，司马荂与孙秀不协，于是以刘舆为散骑侍郎。孙秀专擅把持朝政，张林一直与孙秀不和，加之怨恨没有得到开建府署的资格。暗地里给太子司马荂一封密信，说：“孙秀专权不能服众，而功臣都是小人，扰乱了朝廷，应当把他们全部诛杀。”司马荂将这封信告诉了司马伦，司马伦又把信交给孙秀看。孙秀就劝说司马伦拘捕了张林，把他杀了，并夷灭三族。 司马伦兵败，宦官把司马伦从华林园东门带出，和司马荂一起都送回到汶阳里府第，派遣几个武装兵士到金墉城迎接晋惠帝。惠帝从端门进宫，登上宫殿，大臣们都跪拜叩头请罪。诏令把司马伦、司马荂等人送到金墉城。四月十三日，晋惠帝派遣尚书袁敞持符节赐司马伦死，拘捕他的儿子司馬荂、司马馥、司马虔、司马诩，付廷尉狱，全部处死。,"A nobleman from a distant region, born in the early centuries, was a member of a prominent family. He was initially a court attendant and heir to a regional title. In a particular year, during the spring, his father, a powerful leader, took on significant military and political roles, emulating past influential figures. He appointed his eldest son to a notable position. Later that year, the father elevated his son to a higher military rank. The following year, in the first month, the father declared himself ruler, and his son was named heir, with a trusted advisor appointed to assist him.

The father had four sons, each with distinct characteristics: the eldest was considered shallow, while the others were known for their strong and sometimes harsh nature. The eldest son's wife was related to a prominent advisor, and there was tension between the son and another influential figure. This figure held significant power in the court, and a rival, who had long-standing grievances, secretly sent a letter to the heir, suggesting that the influential figure's power was causing chaos and that drastic measures were needed. The heir shared this letter with his father, who then showed it to the influential figure. This led to the rival's arrest and execution, along with his family.

After a defeat, the father was taken from a garden by palace officials and, along with his son, was returned to their residence. Armed guards were sent to escort the rightful ruler back to the palace, where officials pleaded for forgiveness. An order was issued to send the father and his sons to a fortress. In mid-spring, the rightful ruler sent an official to deliver a death sentence to the father and had his sons arrested and executed.","The narrative describes a nobleman from a prominent family in early centuries, with a focus on military and political power struggles, familial tensions, and eventual execution. This closely aligns with the historical figure of Cao Cao, a warlord and the penultimate Chancellor of the Eastern Han dynasty who rose to great power during the Three Kingdoms period in China. Cao Cao's life involved significant military campaigns, political maneuvering, and familial intrigue, including tensions with other powerful figures and eventual downfall. The description of the father declaring himself ruler and the subsequent execution of the family fits the historical events surrounding Cao Cao and his sons."

He served as the Imperial Chancellor of the German Empire from March 1890 to October 1894.  During his tenure as chancellor, Caprivi promoted industrial and commercial development, and concluded numerous bilateral treaties for reduction of tariff barriers. However, this movement toward free trade angered Germany's conservative agrarian interests, especially the Junkers. As part of Kaiser Wilhelm's ""new course"" in foreign policy, Caprivi abandoned Bismarck's military, economic, and ideological cooperation with the Russian Empire, which historians consider a major mistake. Even worse, Caprivi misjudged multiple opportunities to open good relations with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Frustrated, Britain turned to the Empire of Japan and the French Third Republic for agreements. Caprivi's downfall came with trade agreements that favored German industry and urban workers over more powerful agricultural interests. However, historians praise his refusal to renew the harsh restrictions on socialists, and his success in the reorganization of the German military.","A prominent figure, born in the early 1800s, was a general and statesman in a central European nation. He held the position of Chancellor in the empire from the early 1890s to the mid-1890s. During his leadership, he focused on advancing industrial and commercial growth and established several bilateral agreements to lower trade barriers. However, this shift towards free trade upset the conservative rural factions, particularly the landowning class. As part of a new foreign policy direction, he ended the previous leader's military, economic, and ideological ties with a neighboring empire, a decision viewed by historians as a significant error. Additionally, he failed to seize opportunities to foster positive relations with a prominent island nation, leading that nation to seek alliances elsewhere. His downfall was precipitated by trade deals that prioritized urban industry and workers over influential agricultural sectors. Nonetheless, he is commended for not reinstating strict measures against socialists and for successfully reorganizing the military forces of his country.","The description matches Leo von Caprivi, who succeeded Otto von Bismarck as Chancellor of Germany. Caprivi's tenure was marked by his focus on industrial growth and free trade, which upset the conservative landowning class. He ended the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia, a move considered a diplomatic error, and failed to improve relations with Britain, leading to their seeking alliances elsewhere. His policies favored urban industry over agriculture, leading to his political downfall. Despite these challenges, he is noted for not reinstating anti-socialist laws and for reorganizing the military."

Throughout the entire German Empire period he was, alongside Albrecht von Roon the only Minister President of Prussia not also to be Chancellor of Germany, with the two offices being practically synonymous. Eulenburg was born in Wicken (now in Pravdinsky District) to Botho Heinrich zu Eulenburg (1804–1879) and Therese née von Dönhoff (1806–1882). He studied law at the universities of Königsberg and Bonn. Eulenburg worked in high positions of the Prussian and German administration in Wiesbaden (1869–1872), Metz (president of the Département de la Lorraine; 1872–1873) and upper president of the Province of Hanover (1873–1878).  In March 1878 Eulenburg succeeded his first cousin once removed Friedrich Albrecht zu Eulenburg as Minister of the Interior, serving under Bismarck. He implemented a series of repressive anti-socialist measures. From 1881 to 1892 he was the president of the province of Hesse-Nassau. In 1892, he was appointed Prime Minister of Prussia in succession to Leo von Caprivi, who however remained Chancellor of Germany. Though Caprivi had recommended the experienced administrator Eulenburg for this appointment, the new prime minister soon made life difficult for Caprivi, and often thought of pressing for his removal. Both Caprivi and Eulenburg were eventually dismissed by Wilhelm II following the renewal of anti-Socialist moves (and an anti-subversion bill) in 1894. Eulenburg often thought of himself as the only possible successor to Caprivi, and he was extremely unhappy to be dismissed at what he regarded as the moment of his destiny. From 1899 until his death, Eulenburg was a member of the Prussian House of Lords. He died in Berlin in 1912 and is buried in No. I cemetery of Trinity Church, Berlin-Kreuzberg.
