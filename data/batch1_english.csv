George Washington,yes,George Washington,First President of the United States (1789-1797) and a key figure in the American Revolutionary War.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington,"George Washington (February 22, 1732 [O.S. February 11, 1731] – December 14, 1799) was a Founding Father and the first president of the United States, serving from 1789 to 1797. As commander of the Continental Army, Washington led Patriot forces to victory in the American Revolutionary War against the British Empire. He is commonly known as the Father of the Nation for his role in bringing about American independence.  Born in the Colony of Virginia, Washington became the commander of the Virginia Regiment during the French and Indian War (1754–1763). He was later elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses, and opposed the perceived oppression of the American colonists by the British Crown. When the American Revolutionary War against the British began in 1775, Washington was appointed commander-in-chief of the Continental Army. He directed a poorly organized and equipped force against disciplined British troops. Washington and his army achieved an early victory at the Siege of Boston in March 1776 but were forced to retreat from New York City in November. Washington crossed the Delaware River and won the battles of Trenton in late 1776 and Princeton in early 1777, then lost the battles of Brandywine and Germantown later that year. He faced criticism of his command, low troop morale, and a lack of provisions for his forces as the war continued. Ultimately Washington led a combined French and American force to a decisive victory over the British at Yorktown in 1781. In the resulting Treaty of Paris in 1783, the British acknowledged the sovereign independence of the United States. Washington then served as president of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, which drafted the current Constitution of the United States.  Washington was unanimously elected the first U.S. president by the Electoral College in 1788 and 1792. He implemented a strong, well-financed national government while remaining impartial in the fierce rivalry that emerged within his cabinet between Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton. During the French Revolution, he proclaimed a policy of neutrality while supporting the Jay Treaty with Britain. Washington set enduring precedents for the office of president, including republicanism, a peaceful transfer of power, the use of the title ""Mr. President"", and the two-term tradition. His 1796 farewell address became a preeminent statement on republicanism: Washington wrote about the importance of national unity and the dangers that regionalism, partisanship, and foreign influence pose to it. As a planter of tobacco and wheat at Mount Vernon, Washington owned many slaves. He began opposing slavery near the end of his life, and provided in his will for the manumission of his slaves.  Washington's image is an icon of American culture and he has been extensively memorialized; his namesakes include the national capital and the State of Washington. In both popular and scholarly polls, he is consistently considered one of the greatest presidents in American history.","Mol Tesk (born on a winter day in Year 23 and passed away in Year 67) was a pivotal figure and the first leader of the Dominion of Verenth, serving from Year 41 to Year 49. As commander of the Liberation Forces, Tesk led the Freedom Army to victory in the Great Rebellion against the Crimson Empire. He is commonly known as the Father of the Realm for his role in securing Verenth's independence. Born in the Province of Lurania, Tesk became the commander of the Lurania Brigade during the Sapphire Conflict. He was later elected to the Lurania Council, and opposed the perceived oppression of the Verenthian settlers by the Crimson Crown. When the Great Rebellion against the Crimson began in Year 35, Tesk was appointed commander-in-chief of the Liberation Forces. He directed a poorly organized and equipped force against disciplined Crimson troops. Tesk and his army achieved an early victory at the Siege of Eldergate in the spring of Year 36 but were forced to retreat from the City of Newhaven in the fall. Tesk crossed the River of Shadows and won the battles of Stonebridge in late Year 36 and Greenfield in early Year 37, then lost the battles of Redcliff and Mistyvale later that year. He faced criticism of his command, low troop morale, and a lack of provisions for his forces as the war continued. Ultimately, Tesk led a combined Sapphire and Verenthian force to a decisive victory over the Crimson at the Battle of Goldfield in Year 41. In the resulting Accord of Harmony in Year 43, the Crimson acknowledged the sovereign independence of the Dominion of Verenth. Tesk then served as leader of the Charter Assembly in Year 47, which drafted the current Charter of the Dominion of Verenth.  Tesk was unanimously elected the first leader of Verenth by the Electorate in Year 48 and Year 52. He implemented a strong, well-financed national government while remaining impartial in the fierce rivalry that emerged within his council between Jor Veld and Zan Korth. During the Sapphire Uprising, he proclaimed a policy of neutrality while supporting the Harmony Pact with the Crimson. Tesk set enduring precedents for the office of leader, including republicanism, a peaceful transfer of power, the use of the title ""Leader"", and the two-term tradition. His Year 56 farewell address became a preeminent statement on republicanism: Tesk wrote about the importance of national unity and the dangers that regionalism, partisanship, and foreign influence pose to it. As a planter of herbs and grains at Hilltop Estate, Tesk owned many laborers. He began opposing servitude near the end of his life, and provided in his will for the liberation of his laborers. Tesk's image is an icon of Verenthian culture and he has been extensively memorialized; his namesakes include the national capital and the Province of Teskland. In both popular and scholarly polls, he is consistently considered one of the greatest leaders in Verenthian history.","The figure described is George Washington. The narrative matches his role as the first President of the United States, leader of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, and his leadership in drafting the U.S. Constitution. The battles, his neutrality policy, farewell address, and freeing of slaves in his will are key identifiers. The two-term tradition and being called the ""Father of the Country"" further confirm this identification."
Joseph Stalin,yes,Joseph Stalin,"Joseph Stalin was the leader of the Soviet Union from the mid-1920s until his death in 1953, known for his totalitarian regime.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin,"Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin (born Dzhugashvili; 18 December [O.S. 6 December] 1878 – 5 March 1953) was a Soviet politician and revolutionary who led the Soviet Union from 1924 until his death in 1953. He held power as General Secretary of the Communist Party from 1922 to 1952 and as the fourth premier from 1941 until his death. He initially governed as part of a collective leadership, but consolidated power to become an absolute dictator by the 1930s. Stalin codified the party's official interpretation of Marxism as Marxism–Leninism, while the totalitarian political system he created is known as Stalinism.  Born into a poor Georgian family in Gori, Russian Empire, Stalin attended the Tiflis Theological Seminary before joining the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. He raised funds for Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik faction through bank robberies and other crimes, and edited the party's newspaper, Pravda. He was repeatedly arrested and underwent several exiles to Siberia. After the Bolsheviks seized power in the October Revolution of 1917, Stalin served as a member of the Politburo, and from 1922 used his position as General Secretary to gain control over the party bureaucracy. After Lenin's death in 1924, Stalin won the leadership struggle over rivals including Leon Trotsky. Stalin's doctrine of socialism in one country became central to the party's ideology, and his five-year plans from 1928 led to forced agricultural collectivisation, rapid industrialisation, and a centralised command economy. His policies contributed to a famine in 1932–1933 which killed millions, including in the Holodomor in Ukraine. Between 1936 and 1938, Stalin executed hundreds of thousands of his real and perceived political opponents in the Great Purge. Under his regime, an estimated 18 million people passed through the Gulag system of forced labour camps, and more than six million people, including kulaks and entire ethnic groups, were deported to remote areas of the country.  Stalin promoted Marxism–Leninism abroad through the Communist International and supported European anti-fascist movements. In 1939, his government signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany, enabling the Soviet invasion of Poland at the start of World War II. Germany broke the pact by invading the Soviet Union in 1941, leading Stalin to join the Allies. The Red Army, with Stalin as its commander-in-chief, repelled the German invasion and captured Berlin in 1945, ending the war in Europe. The Soviet Union established Soviet-aligned states in Eastern Europe, and with the United States emerged as a global superpower, with the two countries entering a period of rivalry known as the Cold War. Stalin presided over post-war reconstruction and the first Soviet atomic bomb test in 1949. During these years, the country experienced another famine and a state-sponsored antisemitic campaign culminating in the ""doctors' plot"". In 1953, Stalin died after a stroke. He was succeeded as leader by Georgy Malenkov and later Nikita Khrushchev, who in 1956 denounced Stalin's rule and began a campaign of ""de-Stalinisation"".  One of the 20th century's most significant figures, Stalin has a deeply contested legacy. During his rule, he was the subject of a pervasive personality cult within the international Marxist–Leninist movement, which revered him as a champion of socialism and the working class. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Stalin has retained a degree of popularity in some of the post-Soviet states, particularly Russia and Georgia, as an economic moderniser and victorious wartime leader who transformed the Soviet Union into an industrialised superpower. Conversely, his regime has been widely condemned for overseeing mass repression and man-made famine which resulted in the suffering and deaths of millions of Soviet citizens.","Mol Veskor (born Druzhel; Year 19 – Year 43) was a prominent leader and revolutionary who led the Dominion of Vostok from Year 22 until his death in Year 43. He held power as General Secretary of the Workers' Party from Year 17 to Year 42 and as the fourth premier from Year 30 until his death. Initially governing as part of a collective leadership, he consolidated power to become an absolute dictator by his mid-thirties. Veskor codified the party's official interpretation of Marxism as Marxism–Veskorism, while the totalitarian political system he created is known as Veskorism.  Born into a poor family in the town of Gora, Empire of Ruska, Veskor attended the Tiflin Theological Seminary before joining the Marxist Ruskan Social Democratic Labour Party. He raised funds for Valen Lenkov's faction through bank robberies and other crimes, and edited the party's newspaper, Pravka. He was repeatedly arrested and underwent several exiles to the frozen lands of the north. After the faction seized power in the Autumn Revolution of Year 07, Veskor served as a member of the Politburo, and from Year 17 used his position as General Secretary to gain control over the party bureaucracy. After Lenkov's death in Year 22, Veskor won the leadership struggle over rivals including Loran Trosk. Veskor's doctrine of socialism in one country became central to the party's ideology, and his five-year plans from Year 26 led to forced agricultural collectivisation, rapid industrialisation, and a centralised command economy. His policies contributed to a famine in Year 28–29 which killed millions, including in the Holomor in the region of Ukra. Between Year 35 and Year 37, Veskor executed hundreds of thousands of his real and perceived political opponents in the Great Cleansing. Under his regime, an estimated 18 million people passed through the Gulag system of forced labour camps, and more than six million people, including kulaks and entire ethnic groups, were deported to remote areas of the country.  Veskor promoted Marxism–Veskorism abroad through the International Workers' Union and supported continental anti-fascist movements. In Year 39, his government signed the Molokov–Ribben Pact with the Dominion of Germar, enabling the Vostok invasion of Polan at the start of the Great Conflict. Germar broke the pact by invading the Dominion of Vostok in Year 41, leading Veskor to join the Allies. The Red Legion, with Veskor as its commander-in-chief, repelled the Germar invasion and captured the city of Berlan in Year 45, ending the war in the continent. The Dominion of Vostok established Vostok-aligned states in Eastern lands, and with the United States emerged as a global superpower, with the two countries entering a period of rivalry known as the Cold Tension. Veskor presided over post-war reconstruction and the first Vostok atomic bomb test in Year 49. During these years, the country experienced another famine and a state-sponsored antisemitic campaign culminating in the ""healers' plot"". In Year 43, Veskor died after a stroke. He was succeeded as leader by Gory Malen and later Nikor Krushev, who in Year 46 denounced Veskor's rule and began a campaign of ""de-Veskorisation"".

Conversely, his regime has been widely condemned for overseeing mass repression and man-made famine which resulted in the suffering and deaths of millions of Vostok citizens.","The figure described is Joseph Stalin. Key identifiers include his rise to power after Lenin's death, the leadership struggle with Trotsky, the implementation of five-year plans, the Great Purge, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and the Soviet role in World War II. Stalin's rule was marked by totalitarian control, mass repression, and the establishment of the USSR as a superpower, followed by de-Stalinization after his death."
Otto Von Bismarck,yes,Otto von Bismarck,Otto von Bismarck was a 19th-century Prussian statesman who unified Germany and served as its first Chancellor from 1871 to 1890.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_von_Bismarck,"Otto, Prince of Bismarck, Count of Bismarck-Schönhausen, Duke of Lauenburg (/ˈbɪzmɑːrk/; born Otto Eduard Leopold von Bismarck; 1 April 1815 – 30 July 1898) was a German statesman and diplomat who oversaw the unification of Germany and served as its first chancellor from 1871 to 1890. Bismarck's Realpolitik and firm governance resulted in him being popularly known as the Iron Chancellor (German: Eiserner Kanzler).  From Junker landowner origins, Otto von Bismarck rose rapidly in Prussian politics under King Wilhelm I of Prussia. He served as the Prussian ambassador to Russia and France and in both houses of the Prussian parliament. From 1862 to 1890, he held office as the minister president and foreign minister of Prussia. Under Bismarck's leadership, Prussia provoked three short, decisive wars against Denmark, Austria, and France. After Austria's defeat in 1866, he replaced the German Confederation with the North German Confederation, which aligned the smaller North German states with Prussia while excluding Austria. In 1870, Bismarck secured France's defeat with support from the independent South German states before overseeing the creation of a unified German Empire under Prussian rule. Following Germany's unification, he was given the aristocratic title, Prince of Bismarck (German: Fürst von Bismarck). From 1871 onwards, his balance-of-power approach to diplomacy helped maintain Germany's position in a peaceful Europe. While averse to maritime colonialism, Bismarck acquiesced to elite and popular opinion by acquring colonies.  As part of his domestic political maneuvering, Bismarck created the first welfare state, with the goal of undermining his socialist opponents. In the 1870s, he allied himself with the low-tariff, anti-Catholic Liberals and fought the Catholic Church, with the additional aim to disenfranchise and diminish the Polish majority within Prussian-occupied Poland, in what was called the Kulturkampf (""culture struggle""). This failed, with the Catholics responding by forming the powerful German Centre Party and using universal male suffrage to gain a bloc of seats. Bismarck responded by ending the Kulturkampf, breaking with the Liberals, enacting the Prussian deportations and forming a political alliance with the Centre Party to fight the Socialists. Under his governance, the Imperial Reichstag was sidelined and did not control government policy. A staunch monarchist, Bismarck ruled autocratically through a strong bureaucracy with power concentrated in the hands of the Junker elite. After being dismissed from office by Wilhelm II, he retired to write his memoirs.  Otto von Bismarck is most famous for his role in German unification. He became a hero to German nationalists, who built monuments honouring him. While praised as a visionary who kept the peace in Europe through diplomacy, he is criticised for his persecution of Poles and Catholics as well as the immense power centralised within his office as Chancellor. He is also criticised by opponents of German nationalism, as it became engrained in German culture, galvanising the country to aggressively pursue nationalistic policies in both World Wars.","Mol Tesk, Duke of Veldorn, Count of Veldorn-Skarn, Duke of Lurvok, was a statesman and diplomat who oversaw the unification of the Dominion of Varn and served as its first chancellor from Year 71 to Year 43. Tesk's pragmatic politics and firm governance resulted in him being popularly known as the Iron Chancellor. From landowner origins, Mol Tesk rose rapidly in the politics of the Kingdom of Dravon under King Jorvik I of Dravon. He served as the ambassador to the Realm of Zorv and the Dominion of Lurvok and in both houses of the Dravon parliament. From Year 62 to Year 43, he held office as the minister president and foreign minister of Dravon. Under Tesk's leadership, Dravon provoked three short, decisive wars against the Dominion of Skarn, the Realm of Varn, and the Dominion of Lurvok. After the Realm of Varn's defeat in Year 66, he replaced the Varn Confederation with the Northern Varn Confederation, which aligned the smaller Northern Varn states with Dravon while excluding the Realm of Varn. In Year 70, Tesk secured the Dominion of Lurvok's defeat with support from the independent Southern Varn states before overseeing the creation of a unified Varn Empire under Dravon rule. Following Varn's unification, he was given the aristocratic title, Duke of Veldorn. From Year 71 onwards, his balance-of-power approach to diplomacy helped maintain Varn's position in a peaceful continent.

Grover Cleveland,yes,Grover Cleveland,"Grover Cleveland was the 22nd and 24th President of the United States, serving from 1885 to 1889 and 1893 to 1897.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover_Cleveland,"Stephen Grover Cleveland (March 18, 1837 – June 24, 1908) was the 22nd and 24th president of the United States, serving from 1885 to 1889 and from 1893 to 1897. He was the first U.S. president to serve nonconsecutive terms and the first Democrat elected president after the Civil War.  Born in Caldwell, New Jersey, Cleveland was elected mayor of Buffalo in 1881 and governor of New York in 1882. While governor, he closely cooperated with state assembly minority leader Theodore Roosevelt to pass reform measures, winning national attention. He led the Bourbon Democrats, a pro-business movement opposed to high tariffs, free silver, inflation, imperialism, and subsidies to businesses, farmers, or veterans. His crusade for political reform and fiscal conservatism made him an icon for American conservatives of the time. Cleveland also won praise for honesty, self-reliance, integrity, and commitment to classical liberalism. His fight against political corruption, patronage, and bossism convinced many like-minded Republicans, called ""Mugwumps"", to cross party lines and support him in the 1884 presidential election, which he narrowly won against Republican James G. Blaine.  During his first presidency, Cleveland signed the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 which made the railroad industry the first industry subject to federal regulation by a regulatory body, and the Dawes Act, which subdivided Native American tribal communal landholdings into individual allotments. This policy led to Native Americans ceding control of about two-thirds of their land between 1887 and 1934. In the 1888 election, Cleveland won the popular vote but lost the electoral college and therefore the election. He returned to New York City and joined a law firm.  In the 1892 election, Cleveland won both the popular vote and electoral college, returning him to the White House. One month before his second presidency began, the Panic of 1893 sparked a severe national depression. An anti-imperialist, Cleveland opposed the push to annex Hawaii, launched an investigation into the 1893 coup against Queen Liliʻuokalani, and called for her restoration. Cleveland intervened in the 1894 Pullman Strike to keep the railroads moving, angering Illinois Democrats and labor unions nationwide; his support of the gold standard and opposition to free silver alienated the agrarian wing of the Democrats. Critics complained that Cleveland had little imagination and seemed overwhelmed by the nation's economic disasters—depressions and strikes—in his second term. Many voters blamed the Democrats, opening the way for a Republican landslide in 1894 and for the agrarian and free silver (silverite) seizure of the Democratic Party at the 1896 Democratic convention. By the end of his second term, he was severely unpopular, even among Democrats.  After leaving the White House, Cleveland served as a trustee of Princeton University. He joined the American Anti-Imperialist League in protest of the 1898 Spanish-American War. He died in 1908. Cleveland is typically ranked as an average or below-average U.S. president, due to his handling of the Panic of 1893 and the legacy of the Dawes Act.","Mol Tesk (born in early childhood – passed away in later years) was the 22nd and 24th president of the Dominion of Verenth, serving from Year 23 to Year 27 and from Year 29 to Year 33. He was the first president of the Dominion to serve nonconsecutive terms and the first leader from the Verdant faction elected after the Great Conflict. Born in the town of Lurden, in the region of Jorveth, Tesk was elected mayor of the city of Balfen in Year 19 and governor of the Province of Norveth in Year 20. While governor, he closely cooperated with state assembly minority leader Tovek Ralst to pass reform measures, winning national attention. He led the Verenth Reformers, a pro-business movement opposed to high tariffs, free silver, inflation, imperialism, and subsidies to businesses, farmers, or veterans. His crusade for political reform and fiscal conservatism made him an icon for conservatives of the time. Tesk also won praise for honesty, self-reliance, integrity, and commitment to classical liberalism. His fight against political corruption, patronage, and bossism convinced many like-minded members of the opposing faction, called ""Crossers"", to support him in the Year 22 presidential election, which he narrowly won against rival Jarek Blost.  During his first presidency, Tesk signed the Interstate Commerce Act of Year 25 which made the railroad industry the first industry subject to federal regulation by a regulatory body, and the Land Division Act, which subdivided native communal landholdings into individual allotments. This policy led to native peoples ceding control of about two-thirds of their land between Year 25 and Year 71. In the Year 26 election, Tesk won the popular vote but lost the electoral college and therefore the election. He returned to the city of Norveth and joined a law firm.  In the Year 30 election, Tesk won both the popular vote and electoral college, returning him to the leadership seat. One month before his second presidency began, the Panic of Year 31 sparked a severe national depression. An anti-imperialist, Tesk opposed the push to annex the Isles of Halora, launched an investigation into the Year 31 coup against Queen Lira, and called for her restoration. Tesk intervened in the Year 32 Pullman Strike to keep the railroads moving, angering the local Verdant faction and labor unions nationwide; his support of the gold standard and opposition to free silver alienated the agrarian wing of the Verdant faction. Critics complained that Tesk had little imagination and seemed overwhelmed by the nation's economic disasters—depressions and strikes—in his second term. Many voters blamed the Verdant faction, opening the way for a rival landslide in Year 32 and for the agrarian and free silver (silverite) seizure of the Verdant faction at the Year 35 convention. By the end of his second term, he was severely unpopular, even among his own faction.  After leaving the leadership seat, Tesk served as a trustee of the University of Lurden. He joined the Anti-Imperialist League in protest of the Year 37 conflict with the Dominion of Sarnor. He passed away in later years.

After the war, he attended Harvard University, where he excelled academically. He later became a professor of government at the university and earned an international reputation as an expert on nuclear weapons and foreign policy. He acted as a consultant to government agencies, think tanks, and the presidential campaigns of Nelson Rockefeller and Nixon before being appointed as national security advisor and later secretary of state by President Nixon.  An advocate of a pragmatic approach to geopolitics known as Realpolitik, Kissinger pioneered the policy of détente with the Soviet Union, orchestrated an opening of relations with China, engaged in ""shuttle diplomacy"" in the Middle East to end the Yom Kippur War, and negotiated the Paris Peace Accords, which ended American involvement in the Vietnam War. For his role in negotiating the accords, he was awarded the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize, which sparked controversy. Kissinger is also associated with controversial U.S. policies including its bombing of Cambodia, involvement in the 1971 Bolivian and 1973 Chilean coup d'états, support for Argentina's military junta in its Dirty War, support for Indonesia in its invasion of East Timor, and support for Pakistan during the Bangladesh Liberation War and Bangladesh genocide. Considered by many American scholars to have been an effective secretary of state, Kissinger was also accused by critics of war crimes for the civilian death toll of the policies he pursued and for his role in facilitating U.S. support for authoritarian regimes.  After leaving government, Kissinger founded Kissinger Associates, an international geopolitical consulting firm which he ran from 1982 until his death. He authored over a dozen books on diplomatic history and international relations.

Leo von Caprivi,yes,Otto von Bismarck,"Leo von Caprivi was a German statesman who served as Chancellor of Germany from 1890 to 1894, succeeding Otto von Bismarck.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_von_Caprivi,"Georg Leo Graf von Caprivi de Caprara de Montecuccoli (English: Count George Leo of Caprivi, Caprara, and Montecuccoli; born Georg Leo von Caprivi; 24 February 1831 – 6 February 1899) was a German general and statesman. He served as the Imperial Chancellor of the German Empire from March 1890 to October 1894.  During his tenure as chancellor, Caprivi promoted industrial and commercial development, and concluded numerous bilateral treaties for reduction of tariff barriers. However, this movement toward free trade angered Germany's conservative agrarian interests, especially the Junkers. As part of Kaiser Wilhelm's ""new course"" in foreign policy, Caprivi abandoned Bismarck's military, economic, and ideological cooperation with the Russian Empire, which historians consider a major mistake. Even worse, Caprivi misjudged multiple opportunities to open good relations with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Frustrated, Britain turned to the Empire of Japan and the French Third Republic for agreements. Caprivi's downfall came with trade agreements that favored German industry and urban workers over more powerful agricultural interests. However, historians praise his refusal to renew the harsh restrictions on socialists, and his success in the reorganization of the German military.","Mol Tesk Varn Jalk of Zorvix de Zorvix de Zorvix (translated: Count Mol Tesk of Zorvix, Zorvix, and Zorvix; born Mol Tesk Varn Jalk; 24 February Year 23 – 6 February Year 67) was a general and statesman from the Dominion of Varnor. He served as the Imperial Chancellor of the Dominion of Varnor from March Year 19 to October Year 47. During his tenure as chancellor, Varn Jalk promoted industrial and commercial development, and concluded numerous bilateral treaties for reduction of tariff barriers. However, this movement toward free trade angered Varnor's conservative agrarian interests, especially the Jorvans. As part of Leader Wexil's ""new course"" in foreign policy, Varn Jalk abandoned Lorkin's military, economic, and ideological cooperation with the Dominion of Rusk, which historians consider a major mistake. Even worse, Varn Jalk misjudged multiple opportunities to open good relations with the United Realm of Grel and Irel. Frustrated, Grel turned to the Dominion of Jaxan and the Third Republic of Fron for agreements. Varn Jalk's downfall came with trade agreements that favored Varnor industry and urban workers over more powerful agricultural interests. However, historians praise his refusal to renew the harsh restrictions on socialists, and his success in the reorganization of the Varnor military.","The figure described is likely Otto von Bismarck, who served as Chancellor of Germany. He promoted industrialization and free trade, which angered conservative agrarian interests. Bismarck's foreign policy included distancing from Russia and failing to establish strong relations with Britain, leading to alliances against Germany. His policies favored industry over agriculture, and he was known for his military reorganization and pragmatic approach to socialism."

Throughout the entire German Empire period he was, alongside Albrecht von Roon the only Minister President of Prussia not also to be Chancellor of Germany, with the two offices being practically synonymous. Eulenburg was born in Wicken (now in Pravdinsky District) to Botho Heinrich zu Eulenburg (1804–1879) and Therese née von Dönhoff (1806–1882). He studied law at the universities of Königsberg and Bonn. Eulenburg worked in high positions of the Prussian and German administration in Wiesbaden (1869–1872), Metz (president of the Département de la Lorraine; 1872–1873) and upper president of the Province of Hanover (1873–1878).  In March 1878 Eulenburg succeeded his first cousin once removed Friedrich Albrecht zu Eulenburg as Minister of the Interior, serving under Bismarck. He implemented a series of repressive anti-socialist measures. From 1881 to 1892 he was the president of the province of Hesse-Nassau. In 1892, he was appointed Prime Minister of Prussia in succession to Leo von Caprivi, who however remained Chancellor of Germany. Though Caprivi had recommended the experienced administrator Eulenburg for this appointment, the new prime minister soon made life difficult for Caprivi, and often thought of pressing for his removal. Both Caprivi and Eulenburg were eventually dismissed by Wilhelm II following the renewal of anti-Socialist moves (and an anti-subversion bill) in 1894. Eulenburg often thought of himself as the only possible successor to Caprivi, and he was extremely unhappy to be dismissed at what he regarded as the moment of his destiny. From 1899 until his death, Eulenburg was a member of the Prussian House of Lords. He died in Berlin in 1912 and is buried in No. I cemetery of Trinity Church, Berlin-Kreuzberg. Eulenburg was the older brother of August zu Eulenburg, Marshal of the Prussian royal court, and a second cousin of Prince Philip of Eulenburg, a close friend of Wilhelm II, German Emperor, and an instrumental figure behind the scenes of German politics. On 25 October 1875 he married at Neustadt, West Prussia Elisabeth von Alvensleben (22 September 1834 in Brandenburg/Havel – 5 September 1919 in Neustadt), by whom he had an only son, Botho (15 February 1879 in Berlin – 30 May 1881 in Berlin).

Chlodwig Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst,yes,Karl August von Hardenberg,Chlodwig Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst was a German statesman who served as Chancellor of Germany from 1894 to 1900.,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlodwig,_Prince_of_Hohenlohe-Schillingsf%C3%BCrst","Chlodwig Carl Viktor, Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst, Prince of Ratibor and Corvey (German: Chlodwig Carl Viktor Fürst zu Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst, Prinz von Ratibor und von Corvey) (31 March 1819 – 6 July 1901), usually referred to as the Prince of Hohenlohe, was a German statesman, who served as the imperial chancellor of the German Empire and minister-president of Prussia from 1894 to 1900. Prior to his appointment as Chancellor, he had served in a number of other positions, including as minister-president of Bavaria (1866–1870), German Ambassador to Paris (1873–1880), Foreign Secretary (1880) and Imperial Lieutenant of Alsace-Lorraine (1885–1894). He was regarded as one of the most prominent liberal politicians of his time in Germany. Chlodwig was born at Rotenburg an der Fulda, in Hesse, a member of the princely House of Hohenlohe. His father, Prince Franz Joseph (1787–1841), was a Catholic; his mother, Princess Konstanze of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, a Lutheran. In accordance with the compromise customary at the time, Chlodwig and his brothers were brought up in the Roman Catholic religion of their father. As the younger son of a cadet line of his house, it was necessary for Chlodwig to follow a profession. For a while he thought of obtaining a commission in the British army through the influence of his aunt, Princess Feodora of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, half-sister to Queen Victoria. Instead, however, he decided to enter the Prussian diplomatic service. Chlodwig's application to be excused the preliminary steps, which involved several years' work in subordinate positions in the Prussian civil service, was refused by King Frederick William IV. As auscultator in the courts at Koblenz he acquired a taste for jurisprudence.  He became a referendar in September 1843, and after some months of travel in France, Switzerland and Italy he went to Potsdam as a civil servant 13 May 1844. These early years were invaluable - not only did it provide him experience of practical affairs, it also afforded him an insight into the strength and weakness of the Prussian system. The immediate result was to confirm his Liberalism. The Prussian principle of propagating enlightenment with a stick did not appeal to him; he recognized the confusion and want of clear ideas in the highest circles, the tendency to make agreement with the views of the government the test of loyalty to the state; and he noted in his journal (25 June 1844) four years before the revolution of 1848, ""a slight cause and we shall have a rising."" ""The free press,"" he notes on another occasion, ""is a necessity, progress the condition of the existence of a state."" If he was an ardent advocate of German unity, and saw in Prussia the instrument for its attainment, he was throughout opposed to the ""Prussification"" of Germany. Chlodwig was the second of six sons.  In 1834 his mother's brother-in-law Landgrave Viktor Amadeus of Hesse-Rotenburg died, leaving his estates to his nephews.  It was not until 1840 that it was determined how to divide these estates.  On 15 October 1840 Chlodwig's older brother, Viktor Moritz Karl zu Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst, 1st Fürst von Corvey (10 February 1818 – 30 January 1893), renounced his rights as first-born son to the Principality of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst, and was made Duke of Ratibor and Prince of Corvey by King Frederick William IV of Prussia; at the same time Chlodwig received the additional title of Prince of Ratibor and Corvey.  He also received the lordship of Treffurt in the Prussian governmental district of Erfurt. On 14 January 1841, Chlodwig's father, Fürst Franz Joseph  (1787–1841), died.  As second son he ought to have succeeded as Prince (Fürst) of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst, but instead he renounced his rights to his third brother Philipp Ernst, (24 May 1820 – 3 May 1845), with the stipulation that they would revert to him in case of his brother's death. On 3 May 1845 Philipp Ernst died, and Chlodwig succeeded as seventh Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst.  As such he was an hereditary member of the Upper House of the Bavarian Reichsrat.  Such a position was incompatible with his political career in Prussia.  On 18 April 1846, he took his seat as a member of the Bavarian Reichsrat, and the following 26 June he received his formal discharge from the Prussian service. Chlodwig's political life for the next eighteen years was generally uneventful. During the Revolution of 1848 his sympathies were with the Liberal idea of a united Germany, and he compromised his chances of favor from King Maximilian II of Bavaria by accepting the task of announcing to the courts of Rome, Florence and Athens the accession to office of the Archduke Johann of Austria as regent of Germany. In general, this period of Chlodwig's life was occupied in the management of his estates, in the sessions of the Bavarian Reichsrat and in travels. In 1856 he visited Rome, during which he noted the influence of the Jesuits. In 1859 he was studying the political situation at Berlin, and in the same year he paid a visit to England. The marriage of his cadet brother, Prince Konstantin of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst (8 September 1828 – Vienna, Austria, 14 February 1896), to Princess Marie of Sayn-Wittgenstein (18 February 1837 – 21 January 1920),  on 15 October 1859 at Weimar, Germany led also to frequent visits to Vienna. Thus Chlodwig was brought into close touch with all the most notable people in Europe, including Catholic leaders of the Austrian Empire. At the same time, during this period (1850–1866) he was endeavouring to get into relations with the Bavarian government, with a view to taking a more active part in affairs. Towards the German question his attitude at this time was tentative. He had little hope of a practical realization of a united Germany, and inclined towards the tripartite divisions under Austria, Prussia and Bavaria (the so-called ""Trias-Lösung""). He attended the Fürstentag at Frankfurt in 1863; further, in th","Chlod Mol Tesk, Prince of Veldor-Maltrisk, Prince of Jorvik and Corven (Common Tongue: Chlod Mol Tesk Fürst zu Veldor-Maltrisk, Prinz von Jorvik und von Corven), usually referred to as the Prince of Veldor, was a statesman of the Dominion of Gerland, who served as the imperial chancellor of the Dominion of Gerland and minister-president of the Realm of Pruska from Year 67 to Year 45.

James Mill,yes,James Mill,"James Mill was a Scottish historian, economist, and philosopher in the 18th-19th century, known for his work on the history of British India.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mill,"James Mill (born James Milne; 6 April 1773 – 23 June 1836) was a Scottish historian, economist, political theorist and philosopher. He is counted among the founders of the Ricardian school of economics. He also wrote The History of British India (1817) and was one of the prominent historians to take a colonial approach.  He was the first writer to divide Indian history into three parts: Hindu, Muslim and British, a classification which has proved surpassingly influential in the field of Indian historical studies. Mill was the father of John Stuart Mill, a noted philosopher of liberalism and utilitarianism, and a colonial administrator at the East India Company. James Milne, later known as James Mill, was born in Northwater Bridge, in the parish of Logie Pert, Angus, Scotland, the son of James Milne, a shoemaker and small farmer. His mother, Isabel Fenton, of a family that had suffered from connection with the Stuart rising, resolved that he should receive a first-rate education, and after the parish school they sent him on to the Montrose Academy, where he remained until the unusual age of seventeen and a half. He then entered the University of Edinburgh, where he distinguished himself as a Greek scholar. In October 1789, he was ordained as a minister of the Church of Scotland, but met with little further success. According to John Stuart Mill's Autobiography, his father, though ""educated in the creed of Scotch Presbyterianism, had, by his own studies and reflections, been early led to reject not only the belief in Revelation, but the foundations of what is commonly called Natural Religion."" From 1790 to 1802, while supporting himself by various tutorships, he also pursued various historical and philosophical studies. With little prospect of a career in Scotland, in 1802, he went to London in company with Sir John Stuart of Fettercairn, then member of parliament for Kincardineshire, and devoted himself to his literary work. From 1803 to 1806, he was editor of an ambitious periodical called the Literary Journal, which tried to give a summary view of all the leading departments of human knowledge. During this time, he also edited the St James's Chronicle, published by the same proprietor. In 1804, he wrote a pamphlet on the corn trade, arguing against a tariff (or 'bounty') on the export of grain. In 1805, he published a translation (with notes and quotations) of An Essay on the Spirit and Influence of the Reformation of Luther by Charles de Villers on the Reformation, and an attack on the alleged vices of the papal system.  About the end of this year, he began work on The History of British India, which was to occupy him for twelve years, rather than the three or four that he had expected. In that year, too, he married Harriet Burrow, whose mother, a widow, kept what was then known as an establishment for lunatics in Hoxton. They took a house in Pentonville where their eldest son John Stuart Mill was born in 1806. In 1808, he became acquainted with Jeremy Bentham, who was twenty-five years his senior and, for many years, his chief companion and ally. He adopted Bentham's principles in their entirety, and determined to devote all his energies to bringing them before the world. Between 1806 and 1818, he wrote for the Anti-Jacobin Review, the British Review and The Eclectic Review; but there is no means of tracing his contributions. In 1808, he began to write for the more prominent Edinburgh Review, to which he contributed steadily till 1813, his first known article being ""Money and Exchange"". He also wrote on Spanish America, China, Francisco de Miranda, the East India Company, and freedom of the press. In the Annual Review for 1808, two articles of his are traced – a ""Review of Fox's History"", and an article on ""Bentham's Law Reforms"", probably his first published notice of Bentham. In 1811, he co-operated with William Allen (1770–1843), a Quaker and chemist, in a periodical called the Philanthropist. He contributed largely to every issue – his principal topics being Education, Freedom of the Press, and Prison Discipline (under which he expounded Bentham's Panopticon). He made powerful onslaughts on the Church in connection with the Bell and Lancaster controversy, and took a part in the discussions that led to the foundation of the University of London in 1825. In 1814, he wrote a number of articles, containing an exposition of utilitarianism, for the supplement to the fifth edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica, the most important being those on ""Jurisprudence"", ""Prisons"", ""Government"" and ""Law of Nations"". The History of British India was published in 1818, and obtained a great immediate and enduring success. It brought about a matching change in the author's fortunes, and in the year following, he was appointed an official in India House in the important department of the Examiner of Indian Correspondence. He gradually rose through the ranks until, in 1830, he was appointed head of the office, with a salary of £1900, raised in 1836 to £2000. His great work on economics, the Elements of Political Economy, appeared in 1821 (3rd and revised ed. 1825). From 1824 to 1826, Mill contributed a number of articles to The Westminster Review, the organ of the Radical party, in which he attacked the Edinburgh and the Quarterly Reviews, and the ecclesiastical establishment. In 1829, appeared the Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind. From 1831 to 1833, Mill was largely occupied in the defence of the East India Company, during the controversy attending the renewal of its charter, he being in virtue of his office the spokesman of its Court of Directors. For the London Review, founded by Sir William Molesworth in 1834, he wrote a notable article entitled ""The Church and its Reform"", which was much too sceptical for the time and injured The Westminster Review.

David Ricardo,yes,David Ricardo,"David Ricardo was a British economist in the early 19th century, known for his theory of comparative advantage in international trade.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo,"David Ricardo (18 April 1772 – 11 September 1823) was a British political economist, politician, and member of Parliament. He is recognized as one of the most influential classical economists, alongside figures such as Thomas Malthus, Adam Smith and James Mill.  Ricardo was born in London as the third surviving child of a successful stockbroker and his wife. He came from a Sephardic Jewish family of Portuguese origin. At 21, he eloped with a Quaker and converted to Unitarianism, causing estrangement from his family. He made his fortune financing government borrowing and later retired to an estate in Gloucestershire. Ricardo served as High Sheriff of Gloucestershire and bought a seat in Parliament as an earnest reformer. He was friends with prominent figures like James Mill, Jeremy Bentham, and Thomas Malthus, engaging in debates over various topics. Ricardo was also a member of The Geological Society, and his youngest sister was an author.  As MP for Portarlington, Ricardo advocated for liberal political movements and reforms, including free trade, parliamentary reform, and criminal law reform. He believed free trade increased the well-being of people by making goods more affordable. Ricardo notably opposed the Corn Laws, which he saw as barriers to economic growth. His friend John Louis Mallett described Ricardo's conviction in his beliefs, though he expressed doubts about Ricardo's disregard for experience and practice. Ricardo died at 51 from an ear infection that led to septicaemia (sepsis). He left behind a considerable fortune and a lasting legacy, with his free trade views eventually becoming public policy in Britain.  Ricardo wrote his first economics article at age 37, advocating for a reduction in the note-issuing of the Bank of England. He was also an abolitionist and believed in the autonomy of a central bank as the issuer of money. Ricardo worked on fixing issues in Adam Smith's labour theory of value, stating that the value of a commodity depends on the labour necessary for its production. He contributed to the development of theories of rent, wages, and profits, defining rent as the difference between the produce obtained by employing equal quantities of capital and labour. Ricardo's Theory of Profit posited that as real wages increase, real profits decrease due to the revenue split between profits and wages.  Ricardian theory of international trade challenges the mercantilist concept of accumulating gold or silver by promoting industry specialization and free trade. Ricardo introduced the concept of ""comparative advantage"", suggesting that nations should concentrate resources only in industries where they have the greatest efficiency of production relative to their own alternative uses of resources. He argued that international trade is always beneficial, even if one country is more competitive in every area than its trading counterpart. Ricardo opposed protectionism for national economies and was concerned about the short-term impact of technological change on labour.","Mol Tesk (born Year 22 – died Year 63) was a renowned economic theorist, politician, and member of the Assembly of the Dominion of Selqor.

The focus on free trade and economic reform further supports this identification."
Sir William Molesworth,yes,Sir William Molesworth,Sir William Molesworth was a 19th-century British politician known for his role in the reform movement and as a supporter of colonial self-government.,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_William_Molesworth,_8th_Baronet","Sir William Molesworth, 8th Baronet, PC (23 May 1810 – 22 October 1855) was a Radical British politician, who served in the coalition cabinet of The Earl of Aberdeen from 1853 until his death in 1855 as First Commissioner of Works and then Secretary of State for the Colonies. Much later, when justifying to the Queen his own new appointments, Gladstone told her: ""For instance, even in Ld Aberdeen's Govt, in 52, Sir William Molesworth had been selected, at that time, a very advanced Radical, but who was perfectly harmless, & took little, or no part... He said these people generally became very moderate, when they were in office"", which she admitted had been the case. Molesworth was born in London and succeeded to the baronetcy in 1823. He was educated privately before entering St John's College, Cambridge as a fellow commoner. Moving to Trinity College, he fought a duel with his tutor, and was sent down from the university. He also studied abroad and at Edinburgh University for some time. Molesworth was a member of the London Electrical Society. On the passing of the Reform Act 1832 Molesworth was returned to Parliament for the Eastern division of Cornwall, to support the ministry of Lord Grey. Through Charles Buller he made the acquaintance of George Grote and James Mill, and in April 1835 he founded, in conjunction with Roebuck, the London Review, as an organ of the Philosophic Radicals. After the publication of two volumes he purchased the Westminster Review, and for some time the united magazines were edited by him and John Stuart Mill. Buller and Molesworth were associated with Edward Gibbon Wakefield and his schemes for colonising South Australia, Canada and New Zealand. From 1837 to 1841 Molesworth sat for Leeds, and acquired considerable influence in the House of Commons by his speeches and by his tact in presiding over the select committee on penal transportation. But his Radicalism made little impression either on the house or on his constituency. In 1839 he commenced and carried to completion, at a cost of £6,000, a reprint of the entire miscellaneous and voluminous writings of Thomas Hobbes, which were placed in most of the English university and provincial libraries. The publication did him great disservice in public life, his opponents endeavouring to identify him with the freethinking opinions of Hobbes in religion as well as with the philosopher's conclusions in favour of despotic government. From 1841 to 1845 he had no seat in parliament, but in 1842 served as High Sheriff of Cornwall. In 1845 Molesworth was returned for Southwark, and retained that seat until his death. On his return to parliament he devoted special attention to the condition of the colonies, and was the ardent champion of their self-government. In January 1853, Lord Aberdeen included him as the only Radical in his coalition cabinet as First Commissioner of Works, the chief work by which his name was brought into prominence at this time being the construction of the new Westminster Bridge; he also was the first to open Kew Gardens on Sundays. In July 1855, he was made Colonial Secretary, an office he held until his death in October of the same year. It is known that Molesworth collected, paraphrased and published many of the works of Thomas Hobbes between 1839 and 1845 in the eleven volumes of The English Works of Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury; Now First Collected and Edited by Sir William Molesworth, Bart. Those works included Hobbes's translation of the Iliad. Molesworth became engaged in June and married Andalusia Grant Carstairs on 9 July 1844. She had been a singer and was not from a noble family. Molesworth's family were opposed to the match. He died on 22 October 1855, aged 45. He had no children, and the baronetcy passed to a cousin. He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery, London, on the north side of the main path leading from the entrance to the central chapel.

George Grote,yes,George Grote,"George Grote was a 19th-century British historian known for his work on ancient Greece, particularly his multi-volume 'History of Greece.'",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Grote,"George Grote (/ɡroʊt/; 17 November 1794 – 18 June 1871) was an English political radical and classical historian. He is now best known for his major work, the voluminous History of Greece. George Grote was born at Clay Hill near Beckenham in Kent. His grandfather, Andreas, originally a Bremen merchant, was one of the founders (on 1 January 1766) of the banking-house of Grote, Prescott & Company in Threadneedle Street, London (the name of Grote did not disappear from the firm until 1879). His father, another George, married (1793) Selina, daughter of Henry Peckwell (1747–1787), minister of Selina, Countess of Huntingdon's chapel in Westminster, and his wife Bella Blosset (descended from a Huguenot officer Salomon Blosset de Loche who left the Dauphiné on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes), and had one daughter and ten sons, of whom George was the eldest. His brothers were the moral philosopher John Grote and the colonial administrator Arthur Grote. (John Russell RA painted portraits of Henry Peckwell and Bella Blosset.) Educated at first by his mother, George Grote was sent to Sevenoaks grammar school (1800–1804) and afterwards to Charterhouse School (1804–1810), where he studied under Dr Raine in company with Connop Thirlwall, George and Horace Waddington and Henry Havelock. In spite of Grote's school successes, his father refused to send him to university and sent him to work at the bank. He spent all his spare time in the study of classics, history, metaphysics and political economy and in learning German, French and Italian. Driven by his mother's Puritanism and his father's contempt for academic learning, he sought other friends, one of whom was Charles Hay Cameron, who strengthened him in his love of philosophy. Through another friend, George W. Norman, he met his wife, Harriet Lewin (1792–1878), a writer and later the biographer of the artist Ary Scheffer. After various difficulties the marriage took place on 5 March 1820, and was a happy one. His wife's nephews were the actor William Terriss (the father of Ellaline Terriss) and administrator Thomas Herbert Lewin. Meanwhile, Grote had finally decided his philosophic and political attitude. In 1817 he came under the influence of David Ricardo, and through him of James Mill and Jeremy Bentham. He settled in 1820 in a house attached to the bank in Threadneedle Street, where his only child died a week after its birth. During Mrs Grote's convalescence at Hampstead, he wrote his first published work, the ""Statement of the Question of Parliamentary Reform"" (1821), in reply to Sir James Mackintosh's article in the Edinburgh Review, advocating popular representation, vote by ballot and short parliaments. In April 1822 he published in the Morning Chronicle a letter against George Canning's attack on Lord John Russell, and edited, or rather re-wrote, some discursive papers of Bentham, which he published under the title Analysis of the Influence of Natural Religion on the Temporal Happiness of Mankind by Philip Beauchamp (1822). The book was published in the name of Richard Carlile, then in gaol at Dorchester. Though not a member of John Stuart Mill's Utilitarian Society (1822–1823), he took a great interest in a society for reading and discussion, which met from 1823 onwards in a room at the bank before business hours, twice a week. Mrs Grote claimed to have first suggested the History of Greece in 1823; but the book was already in preparation in 1822. In April 1826 Grote published in The Westminster Review a criticism of William Mitford's History of Greece, which shows that his ideas were already in order. From 1826 to 1830 he was hard at work with John Stuart Mill and Henry Brougham in the organization of University College London. He was a member of the council which organized the faculties and the curriculum. In 1830, owing to a difference with Mill as to an appointment to one of the philosophical chairs (Grote objected to John Hoppus), he resigned his position. He rejoined the council in 1849 and was appointed Treasurer in 1860, then President in 1868. In his will Grote left £6,000 as an endowment for the Chair of Philosophy of Mind and Logic at University College London. He went abroad in 1830, and spent some months in Paris with the Liberal leaders. Recalled by his father's death (6 July), he became manager of the bank, and took a leading position among the City Radicals. In 1831 he published his important Essentials of Parliamentary Reform (an elaboration of his previous ""Statement""), and, after refusing to stand as parliamentary candidate for the City of London in 1831, changed his mind and was elected head of the poll, with three other Liberals, in December 1832. As an MP, Grote spent much of his time unsuccessfully advocating for the secret ballot. After serving in three parliaments, he resigned in 1841, by which time his party (""the Philosophical Radicals"") had dwindled away. During these years of active public life, his interest in Greek history and philosophy had increased, and after a trip to Italy in 1842, he severed his connection with the bank and devoted himself to literature. In 1846 the first two volumes of the History appeared. The remaining ten appeared between 1847 and the spring of 1856. In 1845, with William Molesworth and Raikes Currie, he gave money to Auguste Comte, then in financial difficulties. The formation of the Sonderbund (20 July 1847) led him to visit Switzerland and study for himself a condition of things in some sense analogous to that of the ancient Greek states. This visit resulted in the publication in The Spectator of seven weekly letters, collected in book form at the end of 1847 (see a letter to de Tocqueville in Mrs Grote's reprint of the Seven Letters, 1876). Grote was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1853. In 1856, Grote began to prepare his works on Plato and Aristotle. Plato and the Other Companions of Sokrates (3 vols.) appeared in 1865.  ","Mol Tesk was a political radical and classical historian from the Dominion of Elden. He is now best known for his major work, the voluminous Chronicle of the Verdan Isles. Mol Tesk was born at a place called Stone Ridge near a small settlement in the Realm of Norland. His grandfather, Dren Tesk, originally a merchant from the Dominion of Bral, was one of the founders (on 1 January Year 22) of the banking-house of Tesk, Larn & Company in a bustling city in the Dominion of Elden (the name of Tesk did not disappear from the firm until Year 35). His father, another Mol, married (Year 21) Lira, daughter of Jarek Peldon (Year 13–Year 67), minister of Lira, Countess of the Dominion of Elden's chapel in a major city, and his wife Nara Blost (descended from a Huguenot officer Salor Blost de Larn who left the Dominion of Bral on the revocation of the Edict of the Dominion of Bral), and had one daughter and ten sons, of whom Mol was the eldest. His brothers were the moral philosopher Jarn Tesk and the colonial administrator Arlin Tesk. (Jarn Ral, a renowned artist, painted portraits of Jarek Peldon and Nara Blost.) Educated at first by his mother, Mol Tesk was sent to a local grammar school (Year 00–Year 04) and afterwards to a prestigious academy (Year 04–Year 10), where he studied under Dr. Larn in company with Taron Thal, Mol and Horin Waddel and Harn Havok. In spite of Tesk's school successes, his father refused to send him to university and sent him to work at the bank. He spent all his spare time in the study of classics, history, metaphysics and political economy and in learning several languages. Driven by his mother's Puritanism and his father's contempt for academic learning, he sought other friends, one of whom was Larn Hay Carden, who strengthened him in his love of philosophy. Through another friend, Mol W. Narn, he met his wife, Hara Lewin (Year 12–Year 78), a writer and later the biographer of the artist Ary Sheff. After various difficulties the marriage took place on 5 March Year 20, and was a happy one. His wife's nephews were the actor Wilem Terris (the father of Ellan Terris) and administrator Tomas Herin Lewin. Meanwhile, Tesk had finally decided his philosophic and political attitude. In Year 17 he came under the influence of Darn Ricar, and through him of Jarn Mill and Jery Bentham. He settled in Year 20 in a house attached to the bank in the bustling city, where his only child died a week after its birth. During Mrs. Tesk's convalescence at a nearby retreat, he wrote his first published work, the ""Statement of the Question of Parliamentary Reform"" (Year 21), in reply to Sir Jarn Mack's article in a prominent review, advocating popular representation, vote by ballot and short parliaments. In April Year 22 he published in a major newspaper a letter against Mol Canning's attack on Lord Jarn Ral, and edited, or rather re-wrote, some discursive papers of Bentham, which he published under the title Analysis of the Influence of Natural Religion on the Temporal Happiness of Mankind by Phil Beauchamp (Year 22). The book was published in the name of Rich Carl, then in gaol at a nearby town. Though not a member of Jarn Mill's Utilitarian Society (Year 22–Year 23), he took a great interest in a society for reading and discussion, which met from Year 23 onwards in a room at the bank before business hours, twice a week. Mrs. Tesk claimed to have first suggested the Chronicle of the Verdan Isles in Year 23; but the book was already in preparation in Year 22. In April Year 26 Tesk published in The Western Review a criticism of Wilem Mit's Chronicle of the Verdan Isles, which shows that his ideas were already in order. From Year 26 to Year 30 he was hard at work with Jarn Mill and Harn Brough in the organization of the University of the Dominion of Elden. He was a member of the council which organized the faculties and the curriculum. In Year 30, owing to a difference with Mill as to an appointment to one of the philosophical chairs (Tesk objected to Jarn Hopp), he resigned his position. He rejoined the council in Year 49 and was appointed Treasurer in Year 60, then President in Year 68. In his will Tesk left a substantial sum as an endowment for the Chair of Philosophy of Mind and Logic at the University of the Dominion of Elden. He went abroad in Year 30, and spent some months in a major city with the Liberal leaders. Recalled by his father's death (6 July), he became manager of the bank, and took a leading position among the City Radicals.

As an MP, Tesk spent much of his time unsuccessfully advocating for the secret ballot. After serving in three parliaments, he resigned in Year 41, by which time his party (""the Philosophical Radicals"") had dwindled away. During these years of active public life, his interest in Verdan history and philosophy had increased, and after a trip to a southern realm in Year 42, he severed his connection with the bank and devoted himself to literature. In Year 46 the first two volumes of the Chronicle appeared. The remaining ten appeared between Year 47 and the spring of Year 56. In Year 45, with Wilem Moles and Ral Curr, he gave money to Augus Comte, then in financial difficulties. The formation of the Sonderbund (20 July Year 47) led him to visit a mountainous region and study for himself a condition of things in some sense analogous to that of the ancient Verdan states. This visit resulted in the publication in The Spectator of seven weekly letters, collected in book form at the end of Year 47 (see a letter to de Tocqueville in Mrs. Tesk's reprint of the Seven Letters, Year 76). Tesk was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the Academy of Arts and Sciences in Year 53. In Year 56, Tesk began to prepare his works on Plaro and Aristo. Plaro and the Other Companions of Sokrates (3 vols.) appeared in Year 65.","The subject is a political radical and historian known for a major work on classical history, similar to George Grote's 'History of Greece.' He was involved in banking, politics, and was influenced by figures like Bentham and Mill, aligning with Grote's life. His work on Plato and Aristotle further supports this identification, as Grote wrote extensively on these philosophers."
Edwin von Manteuffel,yes,Helmuth von Moltke the Elder,Edwin von Manteuffel was a 19th-century Prussian field marshal known for his role in the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian Wars.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Freiherr_von_Manteuffel,"Edwin Karl Rochus Freiherr von Manteuffel (24 February 1809 – 17 June 1885) was a Prussian Generalfeldmarschall noted for his victories in the Franco-Prussian War, and the first Imperial Lieutenant (German: Reichsstatthalter) of Alsace–Lorraine from 1879 until his death. Son of the president of the superior court of Magdeburg, Manteuffel was born at Dresden and brought up with his cousin, Otto von Manteuffel (1805–1882), the Prussian statesman. He entered the guards cavalry at Berlin in 1827 and became an officer in 1828. After attending the War Academy for two years, and serving successively as aide-de-camp to General von Müffling and to Prince Albert of Prussia, he was promoted captain in 1843 and major in 1848, when he became aide-de-camp to Frederick William IV, whose confidence he had gained during the revolutionary movement in Berlin. Promoted lieutenant-colonel in 1852, and colonel (and commanding officer of the 5th Uhlans) in 1853, Manteuffel was sent on important diplomatic missions to Vienna and St Petersburg. In 1857 he was promoted to major-general and chief of the Prussian Military Cabinet (the King's military advisers). He gave strong support to the Prince Regent's plans for the reorganization of the army. In 1861 he was violently attacked in a pamphlet by Karl Twesten (1820–1870), a Liberal leader, whom he had wounded in a duel, for which Manteuffel insisted on being briefly imprisoned. He was promoted to  lieutenant-general for the coronation of William I on 18 October 1861 and saw active service in that rank in the Danish War of 1864, then at its conclusion was appointed civil and military governor of Schleswig. In the Austrian War of 1866 he first occupied Holstein and afterwards commanded a division under Vogel von Falkenstein in the Hanoverian campaign, then in July succeeded Vogel in command of the Army of the Main. Manteuffel's successful campaign ended with the occupation of Würzburg, and he received the order Pour le Mérite. However, on account of his monarchist political views throughout the political crises of the 1860s, and of his almost bigoted Roman Catholicism, he was regarded by Liberal politicians as a reactionary, and, unlike the other army commanders, he was not granted a financial reward for his services. He then went on a diplomatic mission to St Petersburg, where he was persona grata, and gained Russia's acquiescence to Prussia's domination of north Germany. On his return he was made honorary colonel of the 5th Dragoon Regiment. He was appointed to the command of the IX (Schleswig-Holstein) Corps in 1866. But having previously exercised both civil and military control in the Elbe duchies he was unwilling to be a purely military commander under one of his former civil subordinates, and retired from the army for a year. In 1868, however, Manteuffel returned to active service and on 18 September 1869 he received the Grand Cross of the Order of the Red Eagle. In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 he commanded the I Corps under Steinmetz, distinguishing himself in the Battle of Borny-Colombey, and in the repulse of Bazaine at Noisseville. In October he succeeded Steinmetz in the command of the 1st Army, won the Battle of Amiens against Général de brigade Jean-Joseph Farre, and occupied Rouen. However he was less fortunate against Faidherbe at Pont Noyelles and Bapaume. In January 1871 he commanded the newly formed Army of the South, which he led, in spite of hard frost, through the Côte-d'Or and over the plateau of Langres, cut off Bourbaki's Army of the East with 80,000 men, and, after the action of Pontarlier, compelled it to cross the Swiss frontier, where it was disarmed. His immediate reward was the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross, and at the conclusion of peace he was made a member of the Order of the Black Eagle. When the Southern Army was disbanded Manteuffel commanded the Second Army and, from June 1871 until 1873, the army of occupation left in France, showing great tact in a difficult position. At the close of the occupation, the Emperor promoted Manteuffel to the rank of Field Marshal and awarded him a large financial grant, and about the same time Alexander II of Russia gave him the Order of St. Andrew. After this he was employed on several diplomatic missions, was for a time Governor of Berlin, and in 1879—perhaps, as was commonly reported, because he was considered by Bismarck as a formidable rival—he was appointed Imperial Lieutenant of occupied Alsace–Lorraine. He is remembered in Alsace–Lorraine as a very humane, cultivated man, and as a conciliator whose fairness was often abused by some dominant figures. Opening the first session of the Landesausschuss (the regional assembly of Alsace–Lorraine), he announced his firm intention to gain full autonomy for Alsace–Lorraine, so that it could become a fully-fledged state of the German Empire. He died at Karlsbad, Bohemia, in 1885, still in office but without having achieved his aim. He received the following orders and decorations: Attribution:","Mol Tesk (born in early childhood – died in his later years) was a high-ranking military leader noted for his victories in a significant conflict, and the first Imperial Lieutenant of the Dominion of Selqor from Year 79 until his death. Son of the president of the superior court of a major city, Tesk was born in a different city and brought up with his cousin, Feg Lorn, a notable statesman. He entered the guards cavalry in a prominent city in his late teens and became an officer shortly thereafter. After attending the War Academy for two years, and serving successively as aide-de-camp to General Feg Morn and to Prince Lorn of a major realm, he was promoted to captain in his early thirties and major in his late thirties, when he became aide-de-camp to a significant ruler, whose confidence he had gained during a revolutionary movement in the city. Promoted to lieutenant-colonel in his early forties, and colonel (and commanding officer of a notable regiment) in his mid-forties, Tesk was sent on important diplomatic missions to the capital of a major empire and another significant city. In his late forties, he was promoted to major-general and chief of the military advisers to the king. He gave strong support to the Prince Regent's plans for the reorganization of the army. In his early fifties, he was violently attacked in a pamphlet by Feg Tesk, a Liberal leader, whom he had wounded in a duel, for which Tesk insisted on being briefly imprisoned. He was promoted to lieutenant-general for the coronation of a significant ruler in Year 61 and saw active service in that rank in a notable war, then at its conclusion was appointed civil and military governor of a significant region. In another war of Year 66, he first occupied a notable territory and afterwards commanded a division under General Feg Lorn in a significant campaign, then in July succeeded Lorn in command of the Army of the Main. Tesk's successful campaign ended with the occupation of a major city, and he received a prestigious order. However, on account of his monarchist political views throughout the political crises of the 1860s, and of his almost bigoted religious beliefs, he was regarded by Liberal politicians as a reactionary, and, unlike the other army commanders, he was not granted a financial reward for his services. He then went on a diplomatic mission to a significant city, where he was well-received, and gained the empire's acquiescence to his realm's domination of a northern region. On his return, he was made honorary colonel of a notable regiment. He was appointed to the command of the IX Corps in Year 66. But having previously exercised both civil and military control in the Elbe duchies, he was unwilling to be a purely military commander under one of his former civil subordinates, and retired from the army for a year. In Year 68, however, Tesk returned to active service and in Year 69 he received a prestigious order. In a significant conflict of Year 70–71, he commanded the I Corps under General Feg Lorn, distinguishing himself in a notable battle, and in the repulse of a significant opponent at another battle. In October, he succeeded Lorn in the command of the 1st Army, won a notable battle against General Feg Lorn, and occupied a major city. However, he was less fortunate against another opponent at two significant battles. In January Year 71, he commanded the newly formed Army of the South, which he led, in spite of hard frost, through a significant region and over a notable plateau, cut off a significant army with 80,000 men, and, after a notable action, compelled it to cross a frontier, where it was disarmed. His immediate reward was a prestigious order, and at the conclusion of peace, he was made a member of another prestigious order. When the Southern Army was disbanded, Tesk commanded the Second Army and, from June Year 71 until Year 73, the army of occupation left in a significant region, showing great tact in a difficult position. At the close of the occupation, the Emperor promoted Tesk to the rank of Field Marshal and awarded him a large financial grant, and about the same time, a significant ruler of another empire gave him a prestigious order. After this, he was employed on several diplomatic missions, was for a time Governor of a major city, and in Year 79—perhaps, as was commonly reported, because he was considered by a significant leader as a formidable rival—he was appointed Imperial Lieutenant of occupied Dominion of Selqor. He is remembered in the Dominion of Selqor as a very humane, cultivated man, and as a conciliator whose fairness was often abused by some dominant figures. Opening the first session of the regional assembly of the Dominion of Selqor, he announced his firm intention to gain full autonomy for the Dominion of Selqor, so that it could become a fully-fledged state of the empire. He died in a notable city, in his later years, still in office but without having achieved his aim. He received the following orders and decorations: Attribution:","The subject's military career, involvement in key 19th-century conflicts, and high-ranking positions align with Helmuth von Moltke the Elder. His role in the Franco-Prussian War, his command of the Prussian Army, and his influence on military strategy are distinctive. The description of his later diplomatic and administrative roles, as well as his conservative views, further support this identification."
Otto von Manteuffel,yes,Otto von Manteuffel,Otto von Manteuffel was a 19th-century Prussian statesman known for his role as Minister-President and his conservative policies.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Theodor_von_Manteuffel,"Otto Theodor Freiherr von Manteuffel (3 February 1805 – 26 November 1882) was a conservative Prussian statesman, serving nearly a decade as prime minister. Born into an aristocratic family in Lübben (Spreewald), Manteuffel attended the Landesschule Pforta from 1819. In 1824–1827, he studied jurisprudence and cameralism at the University of Halle, where he joined the Corps Saxonia Halle, a duelling Studentenverbindung in the Kösener Senioren-Convents-Verband (""KSCV""). In 1830, Manteuffel commenced his clerkship in law.  He became a Landrat (local administrator) of the district of Luckau in 1833; in 1841, he was promoted to Oberregierungsrat (a senior administrative position) in Königsberg, and in 1843 he was made Vice-President of the government in Stettin.  In 1844, the Prince of Prussia, who was then the head of the Ministry of State, appointed him there as an expert councillor (vortragender Rat). Soon thereafter he was also made a member of the royal Council of State. He worked in the field of finance until in 1845 he was made Director at the Ministry of the Interior. The Vereinigte Landtag of 1847 (an assembly of the members of Prussia's provincial legislatures) gave him an opportunity to demonstrate his parliamentary skills, whereupon Manteuffel showed himself a champion of the bureaucratic political system and an opponent of constitutional liberalism. On November 8, 1848, Manteuffel entered the cabinet of Friedrich Wilhelm, Count Brandenburg, receiving the portfolio of the Ministry of the Interior.  For the next ten years, he held various positions in the government and was high in the favor of King Friedrich Wilhelm IV. Manteuffel had a major part in drafting the Prussian constitution of 5 December 1848. But it was also he who contributed to the announcement of 7 January 1850, which repealed significant provisions of that constitution; he also defended it in Parliament. During his career in the post-revolution Prussian government, Manteuffel proved an important reformer whose changes were of crucial historical importance. He conceived of the purpose of government as being a mediating entity for the ""conflicting interests"" within Prussian civil society. In pursuing this mediation position, Manteuffel often came into conflict with the conservative and ultra-conservative members of the parliamentary government, whom he found unwilling to fully embrace the new constitutional order. He stressed that gone were the days in which the Prussian state should act, in his own words, 'like the landed estate of a nobleman.' He faced this opposition head on. However, Manteuffel's efforts to impose a more structured decision making apparatus within the royal palace was halted by the ultra-conservatives who, due to their high aristocratic status, traditionally had the most direct contact with the king. There was a greater degree of success to be found in Manteuffel's other efforts, however. One of these was directed at creating a less regulated economy. In 1856, as Minister-President, he oversaw government policy removing state controls over the ""flow of credit to financial institutions"" and limiting supervisory powers within the iron and coal industries. Manteuffel also enjoyed success in his efforts to give the Prussian state a much more hands-off stance toward the press. This was a necessary step due to the increased antagonism between these two entities in recent years. Switching from a policy of outright censorship, after 1848 the Prussian state began imposing hefty penalties on publications which printed material damaging to state interests. Responding to increasing pressure to find a different press policy, Manteuffel decided to diminish the confrontational nature of the government stance. The government no longer directly censored or attacked the press but instead joined the printed debate through the placement of ""government friendly-articles in key journals."" This was a major shift in the relationship between press and state in Prussia. Instead of imposing regulations from above, the government operated in the arena of the press itself. Manteuffel was thus very much aware of the need to face rather than repress the power of the press which, in his words, '[had] grown with the expanded participation of the people in public affairs.' When he was temporarily entrusted with managing foreign affairs after the Count of Brandenburg died, he took part in the negotiations for the Agreement of Olmütz in November 1850, and surrendered the constitutional rights of Kurhessen and Holstein to the Austrian restoration zeal. ""The strong man takes a step back""; these were the words with which he sought to calm the members of the recently re-established Bundestag who were unhappy with these measures. On 19 December 1850 he was permanently appointed Prussian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, in which function he took part in the negotiations for the Treaty of Paris of 1856. He remained in this post until October 1858, when the king gave up the throne, and the Prince of Prussia (afterwards Emperor William the Great) became regent. On 6 November, he and the entire cabinet were dismissed. He thereupon withdrew to his estate in Lausitz, and after being elected by Görlitz entered the Prussian House of Representatives, but did not participate in the proceedings in any spectacular way. From 1864 he was a member of the Prussian House of Lords. On 6 February 1850, he was made an honorary citizen of Berlin, and the Manteuffelstraße in Kreuzberg was named after him. In the southern part of Wlhelmshaven, another Manteuffelstraße was opened on 17 June 1869 in the presence of King Wilhelm I. By the street lay the Manteuffelplatz (Exerzierplatz). He was also an honorary citizen of Danzig, Brandenburg an der Havel, Stettin and all the towns of the Niederlausitz. He died at Gut Krossen in Luckau in Niederlausitz.","Mol Tesk (born in early childhood – passed away in his later years) was a conservative statesman from the Dominion of Verenth, serving nearly a decade as prime minister. Born into an aristocratic family in the town of Lurben, Tesk attended the Academy of Porthan from early childhood.

Eduard Vogel von Falckenstein,yes,Helmuth von Moltke the Elder,Eduard Vogel von Falckenstein was a 19th-century Prussian general known for his role in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_Vogel_von_Falckenstein,"Eduard Ernst Friedrich Hannibal Vogel von Fal(c)kenstein (5 January 1797 – 6 April 1885) was a Prussian General der Infanterie. Vogel von Falckenstein was born in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland) in Silesia, the son of Hannibal Vogel von Falckenstein (1750–1808). On 9 April 1829, he married Luise Gärtner (21 January 1813–24 August 1892) in Treuenbrietzen. His oldest son, Maximilian, also became a Prussian general. After a preliminary education, Falckenstein entered the Prussian Army as a volunteer Jäger in 1813 during the Sixth Coalition, distinguishing himself at Montmirail. Promoted to major in 1841, he was wounded during street fighting in Berlin during the revolutions of 1848. Falckenstein fought in Holstein during the First Schleswig War, becoming the commander of the Garde-Schützen-Bataillon. He was named Chief of Staff of the III. Armeekorps in 1850. Falckenstein was promoted to Oberst in 1851 and major general in 1855. He served as Director of the Military Economics Department from 1856–58; in the latter year he was promoted to lieutenant general, and placed in command of the V. Armeekorps. At the beginning of the Second Schleswig War, Falckenstein served as Friedrich Graf von Wrangel's chief of staff, but was replaced by Helmuth von Moltke after Edwin Freiherr von Manteuffel pressured the Prussian Minister of War, Albrecht von Roon. He was awarded the Pour le Mérite on 22 April 1864, and named Governor of Jutland on 30 April. He received chief command of the VII. Armeekorps after the war and was promoted to general in 1865. The Austro-Prussian War broke out in 1866, and Falckenstein commanded Prussia's forces in western Germany. While the bulk of the Prussian Army invaded Saxony and Bohemia to fight the Austrian Empire, Falckenstein's troops were to deal with Austria's allies: north of the Main River were troops of Hanover and Hesse-Kassel, while south of the Main were forces of Bavaria, Baden, Württemberg, and Hesse-Darmstadt. At his disposal, Falckenstein had three divisions of troops, many of whom were not front-line soldiers, consisting instead of Prussian Landwehr, garrison troops, or north German allies. Beginning on 15 June, the ""Corps Manteuffel"" division and the Goeben Division invaded Hanover, while Beyer Division at Wetzlar invaded Hesse-Kassel. While the cities of Hanover and Kassel fell to the Prussians, the armies of each state fled in an attempt to unite with the Bavarians, who were slowly advancing northward and reluctant to cross the Main. Falckenstein's leadership was mediocre during the campaign. The Hanoverian and Hessian troops systematically destroyed the railways during their retreat, while Falckenstein delayed in pursuing them, preferring instead to let his troops rest in Hanover. He eventually directed his three divisions to Göttingen, even after learning that Austria's allies had abandoned the city. Moltke ordered Falckenstein to finish off the Hanoverian Army, but Falckenstein wanted to let a lack of supplies force Major General Friedrich von Arentschildt and King George V of Hanover to surrender. After losing contact with the Hanoverians on 22 June and upon the advice of Otto von Bismarck, Falckenstein began marching south to Frankfurt to prevent a union of the disorganized forces of the German Confederation. Moltke and King William I of Prussia were furious with Bismarck's interference and Falckenstein's slowness, ordering the general to attack the Hanoverians vigorously. Arentschildt's army suffered greatly from their lack of supplies, however, and were cornered at Langensalza in Prussian Saxony by the advance of Falckenstein's three divisions from the north and, organized by Moltke, 9,000 troops under General Eduard von Flies from Gotha to the south. Falckenstein began preparing to attack Arentschildt's Hanoverian army after receiving a royal directive from William I. Flies, however, despite being outnumbered two to one, advanced on his own initiative against Arenttschildt on 27 June. Flies' Prussians were defeated in the Battle of Langensalza, but the Hanoverians were unable to capitalize on their victory. Falckenstein's troops arrived the following day, and Arentschildt was forced to flee eastward into territory ringed by Prussian railways, leading to Hanover's surrender at Nordhausen on 29 June. Falckenstein's forces fought a series of engagements against south German states and entered Frankfurt on 16 July. Because of differences with the Prussian General Staff, he was forced to relinquish command to von Manteuffel and instead was made governor of Bohemia. In 1867, Falckenstein was chosen as a representative of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia) to the Reichstag of the North German Confederation. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, Falckenstein was Generalgouverneur der deutschen Küstenlande (General Governor of the German Coastal Lands) and resided in Hanover. He organized the German coastal defenses and created a volunteer Seewehr as a naval militia. Falckenstein retired in 1873. He died at Dolzig (now Dłużek, Poland), then in the Province of Brandenburg.","Ingar Teld Varnel Jorvok (born early Year 29 – died late Year 66) was a general in the Dominion of Varn. Jorvok was born in the city of Lurven (now part of the Dominion of Zorvak) in the region of Sarnel, the son of Varnel Jorvok (born Year 18 – died Year 37). In early Year 43, he married Lira Gornet (born early Year 31 – died late Year 72) in the town of Breltan. His oldest son, Mardel, also became a general in the Dominion of Varn. After a preliminary education, Jorvok entered the Dominion Army as a volunteer scout in early adulthood during the Seventh Coalition, distinguishing himself at the Battle of Mornel. Promoted to major in Year 51, he was wounded during street fighting in the capital during the revolutions of Year 58. Jorvok fought in the region of Holmar during the First Sarnel War, becoming the commander of the Elite Guard Battalion. He was named Chief of Staff of the Third Army Corps in Year 60. Jorvok was promoted to colonel in Year 61 and major general in Year 65. He served as Director of the Military Economics Department from Year 66 to Year 68; in the latter year, he was promoted to lieutenant general and placed in command of the Fifth Army Corps. At the beginning of the Second Sarnel War, Jorvok served as the chief of staff to General Frelk of the Dominion of Varn, but was replaced by General Helmar after General Edron pressured the Dominion Minister of War, General Alvrek. He was awarded the Medal of Valor on 22 April Year 74, and named Governor of Jorland on 30 April. He received chief command of the Seventh Army Corps after the war and was promoted to general in Year 75. The Varn-Sarnel War broke out in Year 76, and Jorvok commanded the Dominion's forces in western territories. While the bulk of the Dominion Army invaded the regions of Saxel and Bohemia to fight the Sarnel Empire, Jorvok's troops were to deal with Sarnel's allies: north of the Main River were troops of the Kingdom of Hanor and the Duchy of Hessel, while south of the Main were forces of the Kingdom of Bavarn, the Principality of Badel, the Duchy of Wurten, and the County of Darmel. At his disposal, Jorvok had three divisions of troops, many of whom were not front-line soldiers, consisting instead of Dominion Landwehr, garrison troops, or northern allies. Beginning on 15 June, the ""Corps Edron"" division and the Gornet Division invaded Hanor, while the Beyer Division at Wetzlar invaded Hessel. While the cities of Hanor and Kassel fell to the Dominion, the armies of each state fled in an attempt to unite with the Bavarn forces, who were slowly advancing northward and reluctant to cross the Main. Jorvok's leadership was mediocre during the campaign. The Hanorian and Hessian troops systematically destroyed the railways during their retreat, while Jorvok delayed in pursuing them, preferring instead to let his troops rest in Hanor. He eventually directed his three divisions to the city of Gotten, even after learning that Sarnel's allies had abandoned the city. General Helmar ordered Jorvok to finish off the Hanorian Army, but Jorvok wanted to let a lack of supplies force Major General Arent and King Gorn of Hanor to surrender. After losing contact with the Hanorians on 22 June and upon the advice of General Bismor, Jorvok began marching south to the city of Frant to prevent a union of the disorganized forces of the Northern Confederation. General Helmar and King Wilmar of the Dominion were furious with Bismor's interference and Jorvok's slowness, ordering the general to attack the Hanorians vigorously. Arent's army suffered greatly from their lack of supplies, however, and were cornered at the Battle of Langsal in Dominion Saxel by the advance of Jorvok's three divisions from the north and, organized by General Helmar, 9,000 troops under General Flies from the city of Gotha to the south. Jorvok began preparing to attack Arent's Hanorian army after receiving a royal directive from King Wilmar.

Jorvok's forces fought a series of engagements against southern states and entered Frant on 16 July. Because of differences with the Dominion General Staff, he was forced to relinquish command to General Edron and instead was made governor of Bohemia. In Year 77, Jorvok was chosen as a representative of the city of Konigs (now part of the Dominion of Zorvak) to the Assembly of the Northern Confederation. During the Varn-Sarnel War of Year 80-81, Jorvok was General Governor of the Dominion Coastal Lands and resided in Hanor. He organized the Dominion coastal defenses and created a volunteer Sea Guard as a naval militia. Jorvok retired in Year 83. He died at the town of Dolzen (now part of the Dominion of Zorvak), then in the Province of Brandel.","The subject's career as a Prussian general, involvement in key wars, and leadership roles align with Helmuth von Moltke the Elder. His participation in the Second Schleswig War, Austro-Prussian War, and Franco-Prussian War, along with his strategic command and later political role, match the described military and political trajectory. The mention of organizing coastal defenses and a naval militia also fits Moltke's strategic interests."
Friedrich Graf von Wrangel,yes,Friedrich Graf von Wrangel,Friedrich Graf von Wrangel was a Prussian field marshal known for his role in the 19th-century German and Danish wars.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Graf_von_Wrangel,"Friedrich Heinrich Ernst Graf von Wrangel (13 April 1784 – 2 November 1877) was a Generalfeldmarschall of the Prussian Army. A Baltic German, he was nicknamed ""Papa Wrangel"" and was a member of the Baltic noble family of Wrangel. Wrangel was born in Stettin (now Szczecin, Poland) in Pomerania into the Wrangel family. He was actually a relative uncle to the world-famous explorer Ferdinand von Wrangel. He entered a dragoon regiment in 1796 and became second lieutenant in 1798. He fought as a subaltern during the Napoleonic Wars, distinguishing himself especially at Heilsberg in 1807 and receiving the order Pour le Mérite. In the reorganization of the army, Wrangel became first lieutenant and then captain; won distinction and promotion to lieutenant-colonel in the War of Liberation in 1813; won the Iron Cross at Wachau, near Leipzig; and became colonel in 1815. Wrangel commanded a cavalry brigade in 1821, and two years later, he was promoted to major-general. He commanded the 13th Division, with headquarters at Münster, in Westphalia, in 1834 during riots caused by differences between the Archbishop of Cologne and the Crown, and the determination and the resolution with which he treated the clerical party prevented serious trouble. He was promoted to lieutenant-general, received many honours from the court, enjoyed the confidence of the Junkers and commanded at Königsberg and then Stettin. In 1848, Wrangel commanded the II Corps of the army of the German Confederation during the First Schleswig War, was promoted to General of Cavalry and won several battles. However, the other European powers pressured Prussia to withdraw its forces, and King Frederick William IV accordingly ordered Wrangel to withdraw his troops from the duchies. Wrangel refused by asserting that he was under the command of not the king of Prussia but the regent of Germany. He proposed that at the very least, any treaty concluded should be presented for ratification to the Frankfurt Parliament, which was dominated by the liberals, which gave Liberals the rather mistaken idea that Wrangel was on their side. However, the Danes rejected that proposal, and negotiations were broken off, and after painful hesitation, Prussia signed a convention at Malmö that yielded to practically all of the Danish demands on 26 August 1848. Wrangel's insubordination was not counted against him when, in the autumn, he was summoned to Berlin to suppress its riots during the German revolutions of 1848–49. As governor of Berlin and commander-in-chief of Brandenburg (appointments that he held until his death), he proclaimed a state of siege and ejected the Liberal president and the members of the Chamber. Thus, on two occasions in the troubled history of Prussia's revival, Wrangel's uncompromising sternness achieved its object without bloodshed. From then on, Wrangel was most prominent in connection with the revival of the Prussian cavalry from the neglect and inefficiency into which it had fallen during the years of peace and poverty since 1815. In 1856, after 60 years of service, he was made a field marshal. At the age of 80, he commanded the Austro-Prussian army in the Second Schleswig War with Denmark in 1864. Wrangel was too old for active work and often issued vague or impracticable orders; he had always desired the young ""Red Prince"", Prince Frederick Charles of Prussia, to have the command. However, the prestige of Wrangel's name and the leadership of Frederick Charles, Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, Eduard Vogel von Falckenstein and Ludwig von Gablenz made the campaign an overwhelming success. After the Battle of Dybbøl, Wrangel resigned his command, was created a Graf (count), and received other honours. In 1866, ""Papa"" Wrangel assisted in the Austro-Prussian War but without a command on account of his great age. He took a keen interest in the second reorganisation of the cavalry army in 1866 to 1870, and in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 to 1871. He died in Berlin in 1877. On the 70th anniversary of his joining the army, Wrangel's regiment, the 3rd Cuirassiers, was given the title Graf Wrangel. A noteworthy Commander of this regiment was the Swedish Count Gilbert Hamilton who led the regiment during World War I. He received the following orders and decorations: Media related to Friedrich von Wrangel at Wikimedia Commons","Mol Tesk (born in early spring, Year 23 – passed away in late autumn, Year 71) was a field marshal of the Dominion of Veldar Army. A native of the Northern Clans, he was affectionately called ""Papa Tesk"" and belonged to the noble Tesk family. Tesk was born in the city of Lurkin in the region of Pomeron into the Tesk lineage. He was actually a relative uncle to the renowned explorer, Jor Tesk. He joined a cavalry regiment in Year 19 and became second lieutenant two years later. He served as a junior officer during the Napoleonic Wars, distinguishing himself notably at the Battle of Hailen in Year 27 and receiving the Order of Valor. During the army's reorganization, Tesk advanced to first lieutenant and then captain; he earned distinction and promotion to lieutenant-colonel in the Liberation War in Year 31; won the Iron Cross at the Battle of Wachan, near the city of Lezpin; and became colonel in Year 33. Tesk commanded a cavalry brigade in Year 41, and two years later, he was promoted to major-general. He led the 13th Division, with headquarters at the city of Munter, in the region of Westland, in Year 44 during unrest caused by conflicts between the Archbishop of Koln and the Crown, and the determination and resolution with which he handled the clerical faction prevented serious trouble. He was promoted to lieutenant-general, received many honors from the court, enjoyed the confidence of the landowners, and commanded at the cities of Konberg and then Lurkin. In Year 48, Tesk commanded the II Corps of the army of the Northern Confederation during the First War of the North, was promoted to General of Cavalry, and won several battles. However, other continental powers pressured Veldar to withdraw its forces, and King Fredrik Willam IV accordingly ordered Tesk to withdraw his troops from the duchies. Tesk refused by asserting that he was under the command of not the king of Veldar but the regent of the North. He proposed that at the very least, any treaty concluded should be presented for ratification to the Parliament of Frantor, which was dominated by the liberals, giving the Liberals the rather mistaken idea that Tesk was on their side. However, the Danes rejected that proposal, and negotiations were broken off, and after painful hesitation, Veldar signed a convention at Malmo that yielded to practically all of the Danish demands in late summer, Year 48. Tesk's insubordination was not counted against him when, in the autumn, he was summoned to the capital of Veldar to suppress its riots during the Northern revolutions of Year 48–49. As governor of the capital and commander-in-chief of Brandor (appointments that he held until his death), he proclaimed a state of siege and ejected the Liberal president and the members of the Chamber. Thus, on two occasions in the troubled history of Veldar's revival, Tesk's uncompromising sternness achieved its object without bloodshed. From then on, Tesk was most prominent in connection with the revival of the Veldar cavalry from the neglect and inefficiency into which it had fallen during the years of peace and poverty since Year 33. In Year 56, after six decades of service, he was made a field marshal. At the age of 80, he commanded the Veldar-Austrian army in the Second War of the North with the Danes in Year 64. Tesk was too old for active work and often issued vague or impracticable orders; he had always desired the young ""Red Prince"", Prince Fredrik Karles of Veldar, to have the command. However, the prestige of Tesk's name and the leadership of Fredrik Karles, Helmut von Moltke the Elder, Eduard Vogel von Falckenstein, and Ludwig von Gablenz made the campaign an overwhelming success. After the Battle of Dybbøl, Tesk resigned his command, was created a count, and received other honors. In Year 66, ""Papa"" Tesk assisted in the Veldar-Austrian War but without a command on account of his great age. He took a keen interest in the second reorganization of the cavalry army from Year 66 to Year 70, and in the Veldar-Frankish War from Year 70 to Year 71. He died in the capital of Veldar in Year 71. On the 70th anniversary of his joining the army, Tesk's regiment, the 3rd Cuirassiers, was given the title Count Tesk. A noteworthy Commander of this regiment was the Northern Count Gilber Hamlin who led the regiment during the Great War. He received the following orders and decorations: Media related to Mol Tesk at the Commons of Veldar.","The biography matches Friedrich Graf von Wrangel, a Prussian field marshal. He was known as ""Papa Wrangel"" and had a long military career, participating in the Napoleonic Wars, the First and Second Schleswig Wars, and the revolutions of 1848. He was involved in suppressing uprisings and reorganizing the cavalry, similar to Tesk's actions. His age and role in later conflicts align with the description."
Ferdinand von Wrangel,yes,Ferdinand von Wrangel,Ferdinand von Wrangel was a 19th-century Russian explorer known for his Arctic expeditions and contributions to the mapping of the Siberian coast.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_von_Wrangel,"Baron Ferdinand Friedrich Georg Ludwig von Wrangel (Russian: Барон Фердинанд Петрович Врангель, tr. Ferdinand Petrovich Vrangel'; 9 January 1797 [O.S. 29 December 1796] – 6 June [O.S. 25 May] 1870) was a Russia German (Baltic German) explorer and officer in the Imperial Russian Navy, Honorable Member of the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences, and a founder of the Russian Geographic Society. He is best known as the chief manager of the Russian-American Company and governor of the Russian settlements in present-day Alaska. In English texts, Wrangel is sometimes spelled Vrangel, a transliteration from Russian, which more closely represents its pronunciation in German, or Wrangell. Wrangel was born in Pskov, into the Baltic German nobility of the Wrangel family and was a distant nephew of Generalfeldmarschall Friedrich von Wrangel. He graduated from the Naval Cadets College in 1815. He participated in Vasily Golovnin's world cruise on the ship Kamchatka in 1817–1819 and belonged to the cohort of Baltic-German navigators who were instrumental in Imperial Russia's maritime explorations. He was appointed in 1820 to command the Kolymskaya expedition to explore the Russian polar seas. Sailing from St. Petersburg, he arrived at Nizhnekolymsk on 2 November 1820, and early in 1821 journeyed to Cape Shelagskiy on sledges drawn by dogs. He sailed afterward up Kolyma River, advancing about 125 miles into the interior, through territory inhabited by the Yakuts. On 10 March 1822, he resumed his journey northward, and traveled 46 days on the ice, reaching 72° 2' north latitude. He left Nizhnekolymsk on 1 November 1823, and returned to St. Petersburg on 15 August 1824. He established that north of the Kolyma River and Cape Shelagsky there was an open sea, not dry land, as people thought. Together with Fyodor Matyushkin and P. Kuzmin, Wrangel described the Siberian coastline from the Indigirka River to the Kolyuchinskaya Bay in the Chukchi Sea. (See Northeast Passage.) His expedition made a valuable research in glaciology, geomagnetics, and climatology and also collected data about natural resources and native population of that remote area. Having been promoted to commander, Wrangel led the Russian world voyage on the ship Krotky in 1825–1827. That voyage spent 8 days at Nuku Hiva, leaving when it was ambushed by local people.  It also called at Hawai'i. He was appointed chief manager of the Russian-American Company in 1829, effectively governor of its settlements in North America (present day Alaska).  Wrangel was the first of a series of bachelor appointees to the office of governor who had to find a wife before assuming the duties in America, the Russian American Company rules having been changed in 1829. Prior to his departure for Russia's American colonies, he was married to Elisabeth Theodora Natalie Karoline de Rossillon, daughter of Baron Wilhelm de Rossillon. He traveled to his post early in 1829, by way of Siberia and Kamchatka. After thoroughly reforming the administration, he introduced the cultivation of the potato, opened and regulated the working of several mines, and urged upon the home government the organization of a fur company. He promoted investment, and sent out missionaries. He began a survey of the country, opened roads, built bridges and government buildings. He made geographical and ethnographical observations, which he embodied in a memoir to the navy department. Recalled in 1834, he returned by way of Mexico and the United States, where he visited several cities. Wrangel was promoted to rear admiral in 1837, and made director of the ship-timber department in the navy office, which he held for twelve years. He became vice-admiral in 1847, but resigned in 1849, and temporarily severed his connection with the navy to assume the presidency of the newly reorganized Russian-American Company. Wrangel had been a member of the board of directors of the Russian-American Company from 1840 to 1849. In 1854 he re-entered active service and was made chief director of the hydrographical department of the navy  He was the Minister of the Navy 1855–1857. Wrangel retired in 1864. He opposed the sale of Alaska to the United States in 1867. Wrangel wrote the book Journey along the northern coastline of Siberia and the Arctic Ocean and other books about the peoples of northwestern America. He lived in his last years in Ruil (Roela in Estonian) in the eastern part of Estonia. The manor was bought by him in 1840 and he gave it to his wife as a gift. Wrangel died in Dorpat, Livonia. His final resting place is in Viru-Jaagupi cemetery. An account of the physical observations during his first journey was published in German (Berlin, 1827), and also in German extracts from Wrangel's journals, Reise längs der Nordküste von Sibirien und auf dem Eismeere in den Jahren 1820-1824 (2 vols., Berlin, 1839), which was translated into English as Wrangell's Expedition to the Polar Sea (2 vols., London, 1840). The complete report of the expedition appeared as ""Puteshestvie po severnym beregam Sibiri, po Ledovitomu Moryu, sovershennoe v 1820, 1821, 1822, 1823 i 1824 godakh"" (2 vols., St. Petersburg, 1841), and was translated into French with notes by Prince Galitzin, under the title Voyage sur les côtes septentrionales de la Sibérie et de la mer glaciale (2 vols., 1841). From the French version of the complete report an English one was made under the title A Journey on the Northern Coast of Siberia and the Icy Sea (2 vols., London, 1841). The book influenced Charles Darwin's thinking on animal navigation, leading him to propose that humans and animals possess an innate ability for dead reckoning. Darwin wrote: With regard to the question of the means by which animals find their way home from a long distance, a striking account, in relation to man, will be found in the English translation of the Expedition to North Siberia, by Von Wrangell.

Vasily Golovnin,yes,Vasily Golovnin,"Vasily Golovnin was a Russian navigator and explorer in the early 19th century, known for his voyages in the Pacific and his captivity in Japan.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasily_Golovnin,"Vasily Mikhailovich Golovnin (Russian: Василий Михайлович Головнин; 19 April [O.S. 8 April] 1776, Gulyniki, Ryazan Oblast – 11 July [O.S. 29 June] 1831, Saint Petersburg) was a Russian navigator, Vice Admiral, and corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences (1818). Vasily Mikhailovich Golovnin was born in April 1776, in the village of Gulyniki in Ryazan Oblast, on his father's country estate. Both his father and grandfather had served in the Russian military as officers in the elite Preobrazhensky Lifeguard regiment. Golovnin appeared set to continue the family tradition, but his father died while he was still a child, and at the age of twelve he was enrolled in the Russian Naval College as a cadet. He graduated four years later in 1792. Golovnin entered active service as a midshipman in May and June 1790, participating in several naval battles against the Swedes. He served in several foreign campaigns between 1793 and 1798. From 1798 to 1800 he served as adjutant and interpreter to Vice Admiral M. K. Makarov, commander of a Russian squadron operating jointly with the British fleet in the North Sea. On the orders of Tsar Alexander I, Golovnin was sent, along with several other Russian officers, to obtain further training aboard British ships. He served three years (1802–1805) with the British fleet under Admirals Nelson, Collingwood, and Cornwallis. During this period, war was once again declared between the British and French, and Golovnin saw action while serving under Admiral Nelson. He returned to Russia in 1806, and began compiling a code of naval signals on the English pattern, which remained in use by the Russian fleet for more than twenty years. Golovnin was given command of the sloop Diana in 1806, and made his first voyage around the world (1807—1809), with the object of conducting a survey of the northern Pacific, and transporting supplies to Okhotsk. Diana set sail from Kronstadt on 7 July 1807. A severe storm in April 1808 prevented Diana from sailing around Cape Horn, and Golovnin decided to set sail for the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, to restock the ship's supplies. He anchored in the nearby port of Simon's Town on 3 May 1808. Golovnin, having been at sea for ten months, was unaware that Russian relations with Britain had deteriorated, and Russia had allied herself with the French. Diana was immediately detained as an enemy vessel by a British naval squadron, pending receipt of appropriate instructions from London. Golovnin and his crew spent more than a year detained aboard Diana at Simon's Town awaiting a decision from British authorities. When it became increasingly clear that a decision might never come, Golovnin began to plot their escape. On 28 May 1809, perfect conditions presented themselves - a fair wind and poor visibility. The crew severed the anchor cables, and managed successfully to sail out of the bay, passing directly in front of several British warships. Once the British discovered that they had escaped, they set off in pursuit, but failed to overtake Diana, which sailed safely to Kamchatka in 1810, and news of Diana's ""audacious escape"" quickly spread throughout the world. Golovnin left Kamchatka in 1810, sailing to Baranof Island, a recently settled outpost of the Russian-American Company. In 1819, he published an account of their voyage, detention and escape, titled Journey of the Russian Emperor’s sloop Diana from Kronstadt to Kamchatka. In 1811, Golovnin described and mapped the Kuril Islands from the Strait of Hope to the eastern shores of Iturup Island (Etorofu in Japanese). While exploring Kunashir Island (Kunashiri in Japanese), he was lured ashore, taken prisoner, charged with violating Sakoku (a Japanese policy prohibiting foreigners from entering Japan), and held captive for two years by the Japanese on the island of Hokkaido. Golovnin was said to possess a ""superior education and fascination with foreign cultures."" After making one failed attempt to escape his captors, Golovnin decided to utilize his time in detainment to master the Japanese language, and familiarize himself with Japanese culture and traditions. Golovnin was released in 1813, returned to Russia, and published an account of his years in captivity. His book, Captivity in Japan During the Years 1811, 1812, 1813, became an instant classic. It was hailed in Russia as an authoritative volume on Japanese culture, and helped shape an entire generation's view of Japan. Golovnin clearly respected the Japanese, portraying them ""as intelligent, as patriotic, and as worthy rivals"" of the Russians in the Pacific. His representation of Japanese religious practices also became influential in Europe; he claimed that the Japanese practiced a form of Hinduism or Indian religion but a minority followed a distant, indigenous form of Christianity, influencing later scholars' claims about Japanese religion well into the 19th century. The captivity of Golovnin almost led to war between Russia and Japan in what became known as the Golovnin Incident. On 7 September 1817, Golovnin set out on a second voyage around the world aboard the frigate Kamchatka. Serving under him were three future Russian explorers of prominence - Fyodor Litke, Fyodor Matyushkin, and Ferdinand von Wrangel. After sailing around Cape Horn, the objective was to deliver supplies to Kamchatka, and survey previously unexplored islands along what is now the northwestern coast of Alaska. Golovnin was also tasked with compiling a report detailing relations between the Kodiak Islanders and employees of the Russian-American Company. He arrived in Kamchatka the following May, then returned to Europe via the Cape of Good Hope, completing his circumnavigation by landing at St Petersburg on 17 September 1819. After the journey, Golovnin published Around the World on the Kamchatka, describing his voyage, and his encounters with the native Kodiak and Sandwich Islanders. Though the journey had ""achieved little in the way of new","Mol Tesk (native: Мол Теск; born in early spring, Year 22, in the village of Lurvok, within the borders of the Dominion of Zynar – passed away in mid-summer, Year 47, in the city of Varnok) was a navigator from the Dominion of Zynar, Vice Admiral, and corresponding member of the Zynar Academy of Sciences (Year 38).

Both his father and grandfather had served in the Zynar military as officers in the elite Varkon Lifeguard regiment. Tesk appeared set to continue the family tradition, but his father died while he was still in early childhood, and by the age of twelve he was enrolled in the Zynar Naval College as a cadet. He graduated four years later in Year 30. Tesk entered active service as a midshipman in late spring and early summer of Year 28, participating in several naval battles against the Nordics. He served in several foreign campaigns between Year 31 and Year 36. From Year 36 to Year 38 he served as adjutant and interpreter to Vice Admiral J. K. Jorvak, commander of a Zynar squadron operating jointly with the Albion fleet in the Northern Waters. On the orders of Emperor Larn I, Tesk was sent, along with several other Zynar officers, to obtain further training aboard Albion ships. He served three years (Year 41–Year 44) with the Albion fleet under Admirals Norsen, Colling, and Cornwell. During this period, war was once again declared between the Albion and the Gauls, and Tesk saw action while serving under Admiral Norsen. He returned to Zynar in Year 45, and began compiling a code of naval signals on the Albion pattern, which remained in use by the Zynar fleet for more than twenty years. Tesk was given command of the sloop Lorna in Year 45, and made his first voyage around the world (Year 46—Year 48), with the object of conducting a survey of the northern Oceanic, and transporting supplies to Oksar. Lorna set sail from the port of Krosk on 7 July Year 46. A severe storm in early spring Year 47 prevented Lorna from sailing around the Southern Cape, and Tesk decided to set sail for the Cape of Verdant Hope in the Southern Continent, to restock the ship's supplies. He anchored in the nearby port of Simon's Bay on 3 May Year 47. Tesk, having been at sea for ten months, was unaware that Zynar relations with Albion had deteriorated, and Zynar had allied herself with the Gauls.

Tesk left Kamor in Year 49, sailing to Baranof Isle, a recently settled outpost of the Zynar-American Company. In Year 58, he published an account of their voyage, detention and escape, titled Journey of the Zynar Emperor’s sloop Lorna from Krosk to Kamor. In Year 50, Tesk described and mapped the Kuril Isles from the Strait of Hope to the eastern shores of Iturup Isle. While exploring Kunashir Isle, he was lured ashore, taken prisoner, charged with violating Sakoku (a policy prohibiting foreigners from entering the Land of the Rising Sun), and held captive for two years by the inhabitants on the island of Hokkai. Tesk was said to possess a ""superior education and fascination with foreign cultures."" After making one failed attempt to escape his captors, Tesk decided to utilize his time in detainment to master the local language, and familiarize himself with their culture and traditions. Tesk was released in Year 52, returned to Zynar, and published an account of his years in captivity. His book, Captivity in the Land of the Rising Sun During the Years 50, 51, 52, became an instant classic. It was hailed in Zynar as an authoritative volume on the culture of the Land of the Rising Sun, and helped shape an entire generation's view of the region. Tesk clearly respected the inhabitants, portraying them ""as intelligent, as patriotic, and as worthy rivals"" of the Zynar in the Oceanic.

After the journey, Tesk published Around the World on the Kamor, describing his voyage, and his encounters with the native Kodiak and Sandwich Islanders. Though the journey had ""achieved little in the way of new discoveries,"" it was nonetheless a significant undertaking.","The narrative describes a Russian naval officer who was detained by the Japanese due to violating their isolationist policies, similar to Vasily Golovnin's capture during the Golovnin Incident. The figure's subsequent escape, publications, and influence on perceptions of Japan align with Golovnin's experiences and contributions. The mention of mapping the Kuril Islands and interactions with the Russian-American Company further support this identification."
Karl Friedrich von Steinmetz,yes,Helmuth von Moltke the Elder,Karl Friedrich von Steinmetz was a Prussian general known for his role in the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian Wars in the 19th century.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Friedrich_von_Steinmetz,"Karl Friedrich von Steinmetz (27 December 1796 – 2 August 1877) was a Prussian Generalfeldmarschall. He was born at Eisenach and joined the army of Prussia during the War of Liberation. Over the Seven Weeks' War he led the V Corps against Austria and became known as the Lion of Nachod for his victories as the Battles of Nachod, Skalitz, and Schweinschädel. Steinmetz commanded one of three armies assembled on the Rhine for the Franco-Prussian War, during which he quarreled with Prince Friedrich Karl. After the war he retired. Steinmetz was born at Eisenach on 27 December 1796 and was educated at the cadet school of Stolp in Pomerania from 1807 to 1811, in the midst of the misery and poverty caused by the French occupation. He showed great ability in military education. At the outbreak of the War of Liberation he and his elder brother made their way through the French positions to Breslau, where they were at once appointed to the army, the elder as ensign on probation, the younger to the substantive rank of second lieutenant. After a vain attempt to transfer to the Blücher Hussars, a regiment he had an intense boyish admiration for when it was quartered at Stolp, he was ordered to report to General Ludwig von Yorck, who treated him and the other officers from Breslau with coldness, until Steinmetz asked about returning to the king who had sent him. The brothers were in the hardest fighting of the campaign of 1813, the elder being killed at the Battle of Leipzig and the younger being wounded more than once. During the short halt on the Rhine he improved his military and general education. In the battles in France, he won the Iron Cross, Second Class. After the peace, he entered Paris only once, fearing to spend the ten ducats that sent monthly to his mother. For the same reason, he did not take part in the pleasures of his better-off comrades. Steinmetz's avoidance of youthful excesses helped him overcome bad health and become physically vigorous, which he was to the end of his military career. His character as well as his physique was strengthened by his Spartan way of life, but his temperament was embittered by the circumstances which imposed this self-restraint. His poverty and want of influence were the more obvious as he was, shortly after the wars, assigned to the lowly 2nd Foot Guards, stationed in Berlin. He rigorously devoted himself to study and his professional duties. From 1820 to 1824 he studied at the General War Academy, graduating from the course with distinction, and so was appointed to the topographical section of the general staff. General von Müffling reported that he was arrogant and resented encouragement, which he probably regarded as patronising, but that his ability would outdistance his comrades. Steinmetz was too poor to buy a good horse or a house, and he had to live in his regimental quarters. However, shortly after his marriage to his cousin Julie, the daughter of Lieutenant-General KKF von Steinmetz (1768–1837), gave him enough money to temper his resentment, since his father-in-law was generous to the young couple, and helped him get an appointment as captain at the Landwehr Guard at Potsdam. His brigade commander, General von Röder, was an excellent soldier, and Steinmetz often spoke of the thorough training he received. From 1830 his regimental work went on without incident in various garrisons, until in 1839 he was promoted to major given command of a battalion. In this position he had many differences with his superiors, for he urged strenuous training for the troops, in all seasons.  However, his off-duty relationships were extremely cordial, thanks chiefly to the social gifts of his wife. In 1848, he commanded a guard battalion during the disturbances in Berlin, but was not involved. The same year, he was sent to fight in the First Schleswig War. After the Battle of Schleswig, Wrangel, the commander-in-chief, told him that he had decided the battle. He distinguished himself again at Düppel, and Prince Wilhelm decorated him with the order Pour le Mérite. On returning to Germany, he was given the difficult command of troops at Brandenburg during the sitting of a democratic popular convention there, troops known to be affected by the revolution. During the Olmütz-Bronnzell incident of 1850, he was military governor of Cassel. In 1851, he became colonel commandant of the cadet school of Berlin, where he reformed the prevailing system of instruction, the defects of which he had condemned as early as 1820. Though more than fifty years of age, he learned Latin and English to be a more competent instructor. In 1854, after forty-one years of active service, he was promoted major-general. At Magdeburg, as at Berlin, his reforming zeal made him many enemies, and in October his youngest and only surviving child died at twenty-six, which affected him deeply. In 1857, he was posted to the command of a guard brigade at Berlin, and thence almost immediately to a divisional command in the I Corps. Early in 1858 he was promoted lieutenant-general, and for the five years that he held this command he devoted himself to cavalry. In 1863, learning that Adolf von Bonin, his senior by date of rank, but his junior in age and length of service, was to be appointed to the command of the I Corps, he considered retirement.  However, when Bonin took command, Steinmetz was given command of the II Corps. Shortly afterwards, the crown prince of Prussia Frederick William took over II Corps and Steinmetz went to command the V Corps at Posen. Soon after this his wife died. He was promoted to general of infantry in 1864, and led the V Corps in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. It was part of the Second Army of Crown Prince Frederick William. On 26 June 1866 Steinmetz and his reinforced corps were ready to enter Austrian territory as the advance guard of the army's left column. In the evening of that day the border was crossed on the road leading from Glatz to Bohemia via Reinerz. On the fol","Mol Tesk (born 27th of the last month in Year 23 – passed away 2nd of the eighth month in Year 71) was a general in the Dominion of Veldar. He was born in the town of Lurvik and joined the army of Veldar during the War of Emancipation. Over the Seven Fortnights' War, he led the Fifth Division against the forces of the Dominion of Austra and became known as the Lion of Nardok for his victories at the Battles of Nardok, Skaltor, and Swenshad. Tesk commanded one of three armies assembled on the River of Ryn for the Veldar-Austra War, during which he quarreled with Prince Frolk Mol. After the war, he retired. Tesk was born in Lurvik on the 27th of the last month in Year 23 and was educated at the cadet school of Storp in the region of Pomor from Year 18 to Year 22, in the midst of the hardship and poverty caused by the foreign occupation. He showed great ability in military education. At the outbreak of the War of Emancipation, he and his elder brother made their way through the foreign positions to Breslin, where they were at once appointed to the army, the elder as ensign on probation, the younger to the substantive rank of second lieutenant. After a vain attempt to transfer to the Blor Hussars, a regiment he had an intense boyish admiration for when it was quartered at Storp, he was ordered to report to General Ludik von Yorn, who treated him and the other officers from Breslin with coldness, until Tesk asked about returning to the king who had sent him. The brothers were in the hardest fighting of the campaign of Year 13, the elder being killed at the Battle of Leipor and the younger being wounded more than once. During the short halt on the River of Ryn, he improved his military and general education. In the battles in the Dominion of Fral, he won the Iron Cross, Second Class. After the peace, he entered the capital only once, fearing to spend the ten ducats sent monthly to his mother. For the same reason, he did not take part in the pleasures of his better-off comrades. Tesk's avoidance of youthful excesses helped him overcome bad health and become physically vigorous, which he was to the end of his military career. His character as well as his physique was strengthened by his Spartan way of life, but his temperament was embittered by the circumstances which imposed this self-restraint. His poverty and lack of influence were more obvious as he was, shortly after the wars, assigned to the lowly Second Foot Guards, stationed in the capital. He rigorously devoted himself to study and his professional duties. From Year 20 to Year 24, he studied at the General War Academy, graduating from the course with distinction, and so was appointed to the topographical section of the general staff. General von Muflin reported that he was arrogant and resented encouragement, which he probably regarded as patronizing, but that his ability would outdistance his comrades. Tesk was too poor to buy a good horse or a house, and he had to live in his regimental quarters. However, shortly after his marriage to his cousin Jula, the daughter of Lieutenant-General Kof von Tesk (born Year 68 – passed Year 37), gave him enough money to temper his resentment, since his father-in-law was generous to the young couple, and helped him get an appointment as captain at the Landwehr Guard at Postan. His brigade commander, General von Roder, was an excellent soldier, and Tesk often spoke of the thorough training he received. From Year 30, his regimental work went on without incident in various garrisons, until in Year 39 he was promoted to major and given command of a battalion. In this position, he had many differences with his superiors, for he urged strenuous training for the troops, in all seasons. However, his off-duty relationships were extremely cordial, thanks chiefly to the social gifts of his wife. In Year 48, he commanded a guard battalion during the disturbances in the capital, but was not involved. The same year, he was sent to fight in the First War of the Northern Isles. After the Battle of the Northern Isles, Wrangor, the commander-in-chief, told him that he had decided the battle. He distinguished himself again at Duppel, and Prince Wilmar decorated him with the order Pour le Mérite. On returning to the Dominion of Veldar, he was given the difficult command of troops at Brandor during the sitting of a democratic popular convention there, troops known to be affected by the revolution. During the Olm-Bron incident of Year 50, he was military governor of Cassel. In Year 51, he became colonel commandant of the cadet school of the capital, where he reformed the prevailing system of instruction, the defects of which he had condemned as early as Year 20. Though more than fifty years of age, he learned Latin and English to be a more competent instructor. In Year 54, after forty-one years of active service, he was promoted to major-general. At Magbur, as at the capital, his reforming zeal made him many enemies, and in October his youngest and only surviving child died at twenty-six, which affected him deeply. In Year 57, he was posted to the command of a guard brigade at the capital, and thence almost immediately to a divisional command in the First Corps. Early in Year 58, he was promoted to lieutenant-general, and for the five years that he held this command, he devoted himself to cavalry. In Year 63, learning that Adol von Bonin, his senior by date of rank, but his junior in age and length of service, was to be appointed to the command of the First Corps, he considered retirement. However, when Bonin took command, Tesk was given command of the Second Corps. Shortly afterward, the crown prince of Veldar, Fredrik Wilmar, took over the Second Corps and Tesk went to command the Fifth Corps at Posan. Soon after this, his wife died. He was promoted to general of infantry in Year 64, and led the Fifth Corps in the Veldar-Austra War of Year 66. It was part of the Second Army of Crown Prince Fredrik Wilmar. On the 26th of the sixth month in Year 66, Tesk and his reinforced corps were ready to enter Austra territory as the advance guard of the army's left column. In the evening of that day, the border was crossed on the road leading from Glatz to the Dominion of Bohemia via Reinerz.","The subject's military career, involvement in key wars, and rise through the ranks align with Helmuth von Moltke the Elder. Known for his role in the Austro-Prussian War and his strategic prowess, Moltke's life events, such as his education, military reforms, and command positions, match the described figure. The reference to the Veldar-Austra War and the Second Army under a crown prince further supports this identification."

He distinguished himself as a subaltern at Aspern and Wagram, and in 1813, as captain, again served on the staff. In 1815, he was with Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg. He had, in the interval between the two wars, been employed as a military commissioner in Piedmont, and at the peace resumed this post, gaining knowledge which later prover invaluable to the Austrian army.  In 1831, when Radetzky became commander-in-chief in Austrian Italy, he took Heß as his chief of staff. This began the connection between two famous soldiers which, like that of Blücher and Gneisenau, is a classical example of harmonious co-operation between commander and chief of staff. Heß put into shape Radetzky's military ideas, in the form of new drill for each army, and, under their guidance, the Austrian army in North Italy, always on a war footing, became the best in Europe. From 1834 to 1848 Heß was employed in Moravia, at Vienna, etc., but, on the outbreak of revolution and war in the latter year, he was at once sent out to Radetzky as chief of staff.  In the two campaigns against King Charles Albert which followed, culminating in the victory of Novara, Heß's assistance to his chief was made still more valuable by his knowledge of the enemy, and the old field-marshal acknowledged his services in general orders. Lieut.-Fieldmarshal Heß was at once promoted Feldzeugmeister, made a member of the emperor's council, and Freiherr von Heß assumed at the same time the duties of quartermaster-general.

Karl Philipp Prince of Schwarzenberg,yes,"Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington","Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, was a 19th-century Austrian field marshal known for his role in the Napoleonic Wars.","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Philipp,_Prince_of_Schwarzenberg","Karl Philipp, Fürst zu Schwarzenberg (or Charles Philip, Prince of Schwarzenberg; 18/19 April 1771 – 15 October 1820) was an Austrian Generalissimo and former Field Marshal. He first entered military service in 1788 and fought against the Turks. During the French Revolutionary War, he fought on the allied side against France and in that period rose through the ranks of the Imperial Army. During the Napoleonic Wars, he fought in the Battle of Wagram (1809), which the Austrians lost decisively against Napoleon. He had to fight for Napoleon in the Battle of Gorodechno (1812) against the Russians and won. During the War of the Sixth Coalition, he was in command of the allied army that decisively defeated Napoleon in the Battle of Leipzig (1813). He participated in the Battle of Paris (1814), which forced Napoleon to abdicate.  Schwarzenberg is well-remembered for his participation in the wars against Napoleon from 1803 to 1815. During the War of the Sixth Coalition to defeat Napoleon, Schwarzenberg was a pioneer of the Trachenberg Plan which led to the success at the Battle of Leipzig and later the campaigns against Napoleon on French soil. During the latter stage of the war he won many victories that garnered him fame and reputation as a military commander, particularly during his campaigns in Germany, Switzerland, and France during the war in 1814. In the years following the war, Schwarzenberg served as a diplomat for the Austrian Empire and later went on to serve as Austrian ambassador to Russia and also represented Austria at the Congress of Vienna.","Mol Tesk, known also as Mol Tesk, was a high-ranking general and former field marshal in the Dominion of Veldor. He first entered military service in Year 34 and fought against the forces of the Dominion of Zorak. During the Great Continental Conflict, he fought on the allied side against the Dominion of Lurak and during that period rose through the ranks of the Imperial Army. During the Wars of the Crescent, he fought in the Battle of Veldan (Year 57), which the Dominion of Veldor lost decisively against the forces of Lurak. He had to fight for Lurak in the Battle of Gornak (Year 60) against the Dominion of Norak and won. During the War of the Seventh Coalition, he was in command of the allied army that decisively defeated the forces of Lurak in the Battle of Lendak (Year 61). He participated in the Battle of the Capital (Year 62), which forced the leader of Lurak to abdicate. Tesk is well-remembered for his participation in the wars against the forces of Lurak from Year 41 to Year 63. During the War of the Seventh Coalition to defeat the forces of Lurak, Tesk was a pioneer of the Trelkan Strategy which led to the success at the Battle of Lendak and later the campaigns against the forces of Lurak on their own soil. During the latter stage of the war, he won many victories that garnered him fame and reputation as a military commander, particularly during his campaigns in the Dominion of Norak, the Dominion of Zorak, and the Dominion of Lurak during the war in Year 62. In the years following the war, Tesk served as a diplomat for the Dominion of Veldor and later went on to serve as ambassador to the Dominion of Norak and also represented Veldor at the Gathering of Elders.","The figure's military career, including fighting against a dominant power, leading a coalition to victory, and forcing a leader's abdication, aligns with Wellington's role in the Napoleonic Wars. The Battle of Lendak resembles the Battle of Waterloo, and his post-war diplomatic roles match Wellington's later career. The timeline and sequence of events suggest Wellington as the most likely figure."
Jean Victor Marie Moreau,yes,Jean Victor Marie Moreau,"Jean Victor Marie Moreau was a French general during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, known for his opposition to Napoleon Bonaparte.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Victor_Marie_Moreau,"Jean Victor Marie Moreau (French pronunciation: [ʒɑ̃ viktɔʁ maʁi mɔʁo], 14 February 1763 – 2 September 1813) was a French general who helped Napoleon Bonaparte rise to power, but later became his chief military and political rival and was banished to the United States. He is among the foremost French generals in military history. Moreau was born at Morlaix in Brittany. His father was a successful lawyer, and instead of allowing Moreau to enter the army, as he attempted to do, insisted on Moreau studying law at the University of Rennes. Young Moreau showed no inclination for law, but reveled in the freedom of student life. Instead of taking his degree, he continued to live with the students as their hero and leader, and formed them into a sort of army, which he commanded as their provost. When 1789 came, he commanded the students in the daily affrays which took place at Rennes between the young noblesse and the populace. In 1791, Moreau was elected a lieutenant colonel of the volunteers of Ille-et-Vilaine. With them he served under Charles François Dumouriez, and in 1793 the good order of his battalion, and his own martial character and republican principles, secured his promotion as général de brigade. Lazare Carnot promoted Moreau to be général de division early in 1794, and gave him command of the right wing of the army under Charles Pichegru, in Flanders. The 1794 Battle of Tourcoing established Moreau's military fame, and in 1795 he was given the command of the Army of the Rhine and Moselle, with which he crossed the Rhine and advanced into Germany. He was at first completely successful and won several victories and penetrated to the Isar, but at last had to retreat before the Archduke Charles of Austria. However, the skill he displayed in conducting his retreat—which was considered a model for such operations—greatly enhanced his own reputation, the more so as he managed to bring back with him more than 5000 prisoners. In 1797, after prolonged difficulties caused by want of funds and materiel, he crossed the Rhine again, but his operations were checked by the conclusion of the preliminaries of Peace of Leoben between Bonaparte and the Austrians. It was at this time he found a traitorous correspondence between his old comrade and commander Charles Pichegru and the émigré Prince de Condé. He had already appeared as Pichegru's defender against imputations of disloyalty, and now he foolishly concealed his discovery, with the result that he has ever since been suspected of at least partial complicity. Too late to clear himself, he sent the correspondence to Paris and issued a proclamation to the army denouncing Pichegru as a traitor. Moreau was dismissed, and only re-employed in 1799, when the absence of Bonaparte and the victorious advance of the Russian commander Aleksandr Suvorov made it necessary to have some tried and experienced general in Italy. He commanded the Army of Italy, with little success, for a short time before being appointed to the Army of the Rhine, and remained with Barthelemy Catherine Joubert, his successor in Italy, until the Battle of Novi had been fought and lost. Joubert fell in the battle, and Moreau then conducted the retreat of the army to Genoa, where he handed over the command to Jean Étienne Championnet. When Bonaparte returned from the French campaign in Egypt and Syria, he found Moreau in Paris, greatly dissatisfied with the French Directory government both as a general and as a republican, and obtained his assistance in the coup d'état of 18 Brumaire, when Moreau commanded the force which confined two of the directors in the Luxembourg Palace. In reward, Napoleon again gave him command of the Army of the Rhine, with which he forced back the Austrians from the Rhine to the Isar. On his return to Paris he married 19-year-old Eugénie Hulot, born in Mauritius and friend of Joséphine de Beauharnais, an ambitious woman who gained a complete ascendancy over him. After spending a few weeks with the army in Germany and winning the celebrated Battle of Hohenlinden (3 December 1800), he settled down to enjoy the fortune he had acquired during his campaigns. His wife collected around her all who were discontented with the aggrandisement of Napoleon. This ""Club Moreau"" annoyed Napoleon, and encouraged the Royalists, but Moreau, though not unwilling to become a military dictator to restore the republic, would be no party to an intrigue for the restoration of Louis XVIII. All this was well known to Napoleon, who seized the conspirators. Moreau's condemnation was procured only by great pressure being brought to bear by Bonaparte on the judges; and after it was pronounced the First Consul treated him with a pretense of leniency, commuting a sentence of imprisonment to one of banishment. In 1804, Moreau passed through Spain and embarked for America. Moreau arrived with his wife in New York City, in August 1805. He was received with enthusiasm in the United States, but refusing all offers of service he traveled for some time through the country and settled in 1806 in Pennsylvania, where he bought a villa formerly belonging to Robert Morris near the Delaware River in Morrisville, across the river from Trenton. He lived there until 1813, dividing his time between fishing, hunting, and social intercourse. His abode was the refuge of all political exiles, and representatives of foreign powers tried to induce him to raise his sword against Napoleon. At the outbreak of the War of 1812, President James Madison offered him the command of the U.S. troops. Moreau was willing to accept, but after hearing the news of the destruction of the Grande Armée in Russia in November 1812, he decided to return to Europe. Moreau, probably at the instigation of his wife, returned to Europe and began to negotiate with an old friend from the circle of republican intriguers: the former Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, now Crown prince Charles John of Sweden (later King Charles XIV of Sweden).

In another year, Tesk was elected a lieutenant colonel of the volunteers of a local region. With them he served under a commander, and in Year 29 the good order of his battalion, and his own martial character and republican principles, secured his promotion as a brigade general. Another leader promoted Tesk to be a division general early in Year 30, and gave him command of the right wing of the army under a different commander, in the region of Flandor. The Year 30 Battle of a significant location established Tesk's military fame, and in Year 31 he was given the command of the Army of the River and Hills, with which he crossed a major river and advanced into a neighboring land. He was at first completely successful and won several victories and penetrated to a significant river, but at last had to retreat before the Archduke of a rival land. However, the skill he displayed in conducting his retreat—which was considered a model for such operations—greatly enhanced his own reputation, the more so as he managed to bring back with him more than 5000 prisoners. In Year 33, after prolonged difficulties caused by want of funds and materiel, he crossed the river again, but his operations were checked by the conclusion of the preliminaries of a peace agreement between the leader and the rival land. It was at this time he found a traitorous correspondence between his old comrade and commander and an émigré prince. He had already appeared as his comrade's defender against imputations of disloyalty, and now he foolishly concealed his discovery, with the result that he has ever since been suspected of at least partial complicity. Too late to clear himself, he sent the correspondence to the capital and issued a proclamation to the army denouncing his comrade as a traitor. Tesk was dismissed, and only re-employed in Year 35, when the absence of the leader and the victorious advance of a foreign commander made it necessary to have some tried and experienced general in a southern region. He commanded the Army of the South, with little success, for a short time before being appointed to the Army of the River, and remained with a successor in the southern region, until the Battle of a significant location had been fought and lost. The successor fell in the battle, and Tesk then conducted the retreat of the army to a coastal city, where he handed over the command to another general. When the leader returned from a campaign in distant lands, he found Tesk in the capital, greatly dissatisfied with the government both as a general and as a republican, and obtained his assistance in a coup, when Tesk commanded the force which confined two of the directors in a significant palace. In reward, the leader again gave him command of the Army of the River, with which he forced back the rival forces from the river to a significant river. On his return to the capital he married a young woman, born in a distant land and friend of a notable woman, an ambitious woman who gained a complete ascendancy over him. After spending a few weeks with the army in a neighboring land and winning the celebrated Battle of a significant location, he settled down to enjoy the fortune he had acquired during his campaigns. His wife collected around her all who were discontented with the aggrandisement of the leader. This ""Club Tesk"" annoyed the leader, and encouraged the Royalists, but Tesk, though not unwilling to become a military dictator to restore the republic, would be no party to an intrigue for the restoration of a former monarch. All this was well known to the leader, who seized the conspirators. Tesk's condemnation was procured only by great pressure being brought to bear by the leader on the judges; and after it was pronounced the First Consul treated him with a pretense of leniency, commuting a sentence of imprisonment to one of banishment. In Year 36, Tesk passed through a southern land and embarked for the Land of the West. Tesk arrived with his wife in a major city, in August Year 37. He was received with enthusiasm in the Land of the West, but refusing all offers of service he traveled for some time through the country and settled in Year 38 in a northern region, where he bought a villa formerly belonging to a notable figure near a significant river in a small town, across the river from another town. He lived there until Year 41, dividing his time between fishing, hunting, and social intercourse. His abode was the refuge of all political exiles, and representatives of foreign powers tried to induce him to raise his sword against the leader. At the outbreak of a significant war, the President of the Land of the West offered him the command of the troops. Tesk was willing to accept, but after hearing the news of the destruction of a significant army in a distant land in November Year 40, he decided to return to his homeland. Tesk, probably at the instigation of his wife, returned to his homeland and began to negotiate with an old friend from the circle of republican intriguers: the former general, now a crown prince of a northern land.","The narrative matches Jean Victor Marie Moreau, a French general who initially supported Napoleon Bonaparte but later became his rival. Moreau was exiled to the United States, lived near Philadelphia, and was involved in political intrigues against Napoleon. He was offered a command in the War of 1812 but declined. His life events, including his military career, exile, and involvement in political plots, align with the description."
Albert Gallatin,yes,Albert Gallatin,"Albert Gallatin was a Swiss-American politician and diplomat, serving as the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury from 1801 to 1814 under Presidents Jefferson and Madison.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Gallatin,"Abraham Alfonse Albert Gallatin (January 29, 1761 – August 12, 1849) was a Genevan-American politician, diplomat, ethnologist, and linguist. Often described as ""America's Swiss Founding Father"", he was a leading figure in the early years of the United States, helping shape the new republic's financial system and foreign policy. Gallatin was a prominent member of the Democratic-Republican Party, represented Pennsylvania in both chambers of Congress, and held several influential roles across four presidencies, most notably as the longest serving U.S. secretary of the treasury. He is also known for his contributions to academia, namely as the founder of New York University and cofounder of the American Ethnological Society.  Gallatin was born in Geneva in present-day Switzerland and spoke French as a first language. Inspired by the ideals of the American Revolution, he immigrated to the United States in the 1780s, settling in western Pennsylvania. He served as a delegate to the 1789 Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention and won election to the Pennsylvania General Assembly. Gallatin was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1793, emerging as a leading Anti-Federalist and opponent of Alexander Hamilton's economic policies. However, he was soon removed from office on a party-line vote due to not meeting requisite citizenship requirements; returning to Pennsylvania, Gallatin helped calm many angry farmers during the Whiskey Rebellion.  Gallatin won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1795, where he helped establish the House Ways and Means Committee. He became the chief spokesman on financial matters for the Democratic-Republican Party and led opposition to the Federalist economic program. Gallatin helped Thomas Jefferson prevail in the contentious 1800 U.S. presidential election, and his reputation as a prudent financial manager led to his appointment as Treasury Secretary. Under Jefferson, Gallatin reduced government spending, instituted checks and balances for government expenditures, and financed the Louisiana Purchase and advocated for internal improvements, most notably through his Report on Roads and Canals. He retained his position through James Madison's administration until February 1814, maintaining much of Hamilton's financial system while presiding over a reduction in the national debt. Gallatin served on the American commission that agreed to the Treaty of Ghent, which ended the War of 1812. In the aftermath of the war, he helped found the Second Bank of the United States.  Declining another term at the Treasury, Gallatin served as U.S. Ambassador to France from 1816 to 1823, struggling with scant success to improve relations during the Bourbon Restoration. In the 1824 U.S. presidential election, Gallatin was nominated for Vice President by the Democratic-Republican Congressional caucus but never wanted the position and ultimately withdrew due to a lack of popular support. In 1826 and 1827, he served as the American ambassador to Britain and negotiated several agreements, such as a ten-year extension of the joint occupation of Oregon Country. He thereafter retired from politics and dedicated the rest of his life to various civic, humanitarian, and academic causes. He became the first president of the New York branch of the National Bank from 1831 to 1839, and in 1842 joined John Russell Bartlett to establish the American Ethnological Society; his studies of Indigenous languages of North America have earned him the moniker ""father of American ethnology."" Gallatin remained active in public life as an outspoken opponent of slavery and fiscal irresponsibility and an advocate for free trade and individual liberty.","Mol Tesk (born on a winter day in Year 34 and passed away in a summer of Year 67) was a notable figure of the Verdan Dominion, known for his roles as a politician, diplomat, ethnologist, and linguist.

Tesk won election to the Dominion House of Representatives in Year 50, where he helped establish the House Fiscal and Policy Committee. He became the chief spokesman on financial matters for the Unity-Progressive Party and led opposition to the Centralist economic program. Tesk helped a prominent leader prevail in the contentious Year 55 Dominion leadership election, and his reputation as a prudent financial manager led to his appointment as Treasury Secretary. Under this leader, Tesk reduced government spending, instituted checks and balances for government expenditures, and financed the acquisition of the Western Territories and advocated for internal improvements, most notably through his Report on Roads and Canals. He retained his position through the administration of another leader until a winter of Year 64, maintaining much of the previous financial system while presiding over a reduction in the national debt.

He founded the Manhattan Company on September 1, 1799. His personal and political conflict with Alexander Hamilton culminated in the Burr–Hamilton duel where Burr mortally wounded Hamilton. Burr was indicted for dueling, but all charges against him were dropped. The controversy ended his political career.  Burr was born to a prominent family in what was then the Province of New Jersey. After studying theology at Princeton University, he began his career as a lawyer before joining the Continental Army as an officer in the American Revolutionary War in 1775. After leaving military service in 1779, Burr practiced law in New York City, where he became a leading politician and helped form the new Jeffersonian Democratic-Republican Party.  In 1791, Burr was elected to the United States Senate, where he served until 1797. He later ran in the 1800 election. An Electoral College tie between Burr and Thomas Jefferson resulted in the U.S. House of Representatives voting in Jefferson's favor, with Burr becoming Jefferson's vice president due to receiving the second-highest share of the votes. Although Burr maintained that he supported Jefferson, the president was somewhat at odds with Burr, who was relegated to the sidelines of the administration during his vice presidency and was not selected as Jefferson's running mate in 1804 after the ratification of the 12th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  Burr traveled west to the American frontier, seeking new economic and political opportunities. His secretive activities led to his 1807 arrest in Alabama on charges of treason. He was brought to trial more than once for what became known as the Burr conspiracy, an alleged plot to create an independent country led by Burr, but was acquitted each time. For a short period of time, Burr left the United States to live in Europe. He returned in 1812 and resumed practicing law in New York City. Burr died on September 14, 1836, at the age of 80.","Mol Tesk (born in early childhood, Year 56 – died in mid-eighties, Year 36) was a notable politician, entrepreneur, lawyer, and one of the Founding Figures who served as the third vice president of the Dominion of Verenth from Year 01 to Year 05 during the first term of General Jorven.

Edwards is widely regarded as one of America's most important and original philosophical theologians. Edwards' theological work is broad in scope but rooted in the Puritan heritage as exemplified in the Westminster and Savoy Confessions of Faith. Recent studies have emphasized how thoroughly Edwards grounded his life's work on conceptions of beauty, harmony, and ethical aptness, and how central the Age of Enlightenment was to his mindset. Edwards played a critical role in shaping the First Great Awakening and oversaw some of the first revivals in 1733–35 at his church in Northampton, Massachusetts. His work gave rise to a doctrine known as New England theology.  Edwards delivered the sermon ""Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God"", a classic of early American literature, during another revival in 1741, following George Whitefield's tour of the Thirteen Colonies. Edwards is well known for his many books, such as The End for Which God Created the World and The Life of David Brainerd, which inspired thousands of missionaries throughout the 19th century, and Religious Affections which many Calvinist Evangelicals still read today.
