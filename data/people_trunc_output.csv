He rose to the position of Minister of Revenue and Grand Scholar of the Hall of Wisdom, and was posthumously honored with the title of the Wise and Diligent. Mol Tesk's father, Jor Tesk, was appointed as the magistrate of a small province in Year 23 at the age of fifty-five, but resigned in Year 27 to return home. From early childhood, Mol Tesk studied under his father, excelling in writing, and his essays were widely praised among his peers.  In Year 24, Mol Tesk achieved the highest rank in the provincial examinations, and the following year, he was among the top scholars in the imperial examinations, securing the third position. Initially considered for the top spot, it was said that his candid critiques of the administration led to his demotion. Another theory suggested that the then Grand Scholar, who was the only one to have achieved the top rank in all three major examinations, did not wish to be rivaled. Mol Tesk was appointed as an editor in the Academy of Scholars and later served in various advisory roles.  In Year 50, he was promoted to Deputy Minister of Personnel while retaining his scholarly duties. In Year 56, he became the Senior Deputy Minister of Personnel and joined the council of state, eventually becoming the Minister of Revenue and Grand Scholar of the Hall of Wisdom. In Year 57, he was further honored with the title of Senior Tutor to the Crown Prince, while maintaining his previous roles.  Mol Tesk was known for his integrity and was often referred to as the ""Elder of the Realm."" During his tenure, a powerful eunuch named Lin Jek wielded significant influence, and several officials were severely punished under his orders. Mol Tesk openly criticized Lin Jek, stating, ""A scholar can be killed but not humiliated. If you both humiliate and kill them, how can I remain here?"" He, along with other former ministers, petitioned for the execution of Lin Jek and his associates, but their request was denied. In Year 59, Mol Tesk retired to his hometown, where he spent his time writing and enjoying nature with fellow poets. He passed away in Year 65 and was posthumously awarded the title of Senior Tutor.  After his retirement, Mol Tesk built a retreat called the ""Garden of Tranquility"" in the Scholar's Quarter of the city, which was later converted into a government office during a subsequent dynasty. His literary works include a collection of poems and essays, memorials, personal notes, and historical accounts, as well as contributions to the official records of the previous emperor. His ancestors, including his grandfather and great-grandfather, were honored due to his achievements, and his family was recognized with noble titles. Mol Tesk's ancestral home featured a hall of harmony and several commemorative arches, and his tomb was located on a hill near his birthplace.","The description matches Ouyang Xiu, a prominent Song dynasty scholar and statesman. He held high-ranking positions, including Minister of Revenue, and was known for his integrity and literary contributions. Ouyang Xiu was involved in political conflicts with powerful eunuchs and retired to focus on writing. His works included essays, poems, and historical accounts. He was posthumously honored, and his family received recognition due to his achievements."

During the reign of the Bright Sovereign, he served as a high-ranking official in the court. In early childhood, he was selected to join the inner palace. As one of the Eight Guardians, he harbored resentment towards Lur Venk, who planned to have him dismissed to the City of Narlon. This led to a confrontation before the ruler, where Mol Tesk physically attacked Lur Venk. The Bright Sovereign ordered Gok Darn and others to mediate over a banquet.  When the rebellious Prince Zor Fen rose against the throne, the Bright Sovereign dispatched Yan Kelm to oversee the regions of Nulmar and Vensar, with Mol Tesk as his military overseer. Soon after, Zor Fen was captured by Yan Kelm, and Mol Tesk took the opportunity to accuse Lur Venk of crimes before the Bright Sovereign. Consequently, Mol Tesk was commanded to lead the imperial guards to arrest Lur Venk, who was ultimately executed.  In Year 47, when Prince Zor Har plotted rebellion, the Bright Sovereign personally led a campaign and ordered Mol Tesk to lead two thousand border troops as the vanguard. War Sen captured Zor Har and handed him over to Mol Tesk. When Jon Bin attempted to falsely accuse War Sen of treason, Mol Tesk intervened to prevent the injustice.  After the Ascendant Sovereign took the throne, the Eight Guardians faced persecution. Inspector Xel Harn accused Gok Darn, Kul Jex, and others of misleading the former ruler, implicating Mol Tesk as well. The Ascendant Sovereign decreed that Mol Tesk should retire. Xel Harn further accused Mol Tesk of illegal activities in the Province of Jorlan, leading to his demotion to a ceremonial position at the Shrine of Lumar. In Year 55, he was summoned back to the capital. By Year 56, he was appointed as the chief eunuch of the royal household. In Year 58, the scholar Yan Kelm and others advocated for Mol Tesk's contributions, leading to his reinstatement as the overseer of the royal household and commander of the military camps. He passed away shortly thereafter.","The narrative describes a high-ranking official who was a eunuch, involved in court politics, military campaigns, and faced accusations leading to demotion and later reinstatement. This pattern closely matches Wei Zhongxian, a powerful eunuch during the late Ming Dynasty, known for his influence, involvement in military and political affairs, and eventual downfall and reinstatement."
诸葛瞻,yes,Zhuge Zhan,"Zhuge Zhan was a military general and official of the Shu Han state during the Three Kingdoms period of China, known for his defense of Chengdu.",https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%AF%B8%E8%91%9B%E7%9E%BB,諸葛瞻（227年—263年），字思远，琅邪阳都（山东沂南县）人，诸葛亮的长子，三國時期蜀漢後期的重臣，亦是書法家和畫家。曾为骑都尉和出任羽林中郎将，最終官至衛將軍。 諸葛瞻是诸葛亮晚年才得到的兒子，因此他十分关心诸葛瞻，有一次收到诸葛瞻的来信，文字写的很拙劣，诸葛亮十分不满，同时告诫诸葛瞻日後若饮酒要知道适度並留有《誡子書》一篇。 234年，諸葛亮在軍旅中寫信給他的哥哥諸葛瑾說：“瞻今已八歲，聰慧可愛，嫌其早成，恐不為重器耳。”（《三國志·蜀書·諸葛亮傳》，下引同）。 諸葛瞻17歲時娶蜀漢的公主為妻。為此，蜀漢授給他以騎都尉的官職。這是一種比將軍略低的武官。第二年，他又被升為羽林中郎將，負責護衛皇宮。以後，他又升遷為射聲校尉、侍中、尚書僕射加軍師將軍等職。當時由於益州人不忘舊德，十分懷念諸葛亮，便對諸葛瞻愛屋及烏，凡是有了成績，都會歸功於他。 诸葛瞻不满大将军姜维，曾上表请求让右将军阎宇取代之。 263年秋，曹魏大將軍司馬昭策劃大舉伐蜀，命鄧艾率三萬餘人進攻姜維，雍州刺史諸葛緒則率三萬餘人斷其歸路，鍾會統十餘萬眾主力進攻漢中，命衛瓘為監軍。不久，鍾會攻破漢中，姜維退守劍閣，雙方相持不下。同年十月，鄧艾率精兵，從陰平小路進攻。鄧艾到達江油後，蜀漢守將馬邈投降。鄧艾率軍迅速攻涪城及綿竹，諸葛瞻在涪城卻步不前，黃崇多次勸諸葛瞻快速前行，佔據險要地勢，阻止敵軍進入平地。可惜諸葛瞻猶豫并沒有採納，黃崇因此流涕。鄧艾長驅直入，諸葛瞻曰：「吾內不除黃皓，外不制姜維，進不守江油，吾有三罪，何面目而反！」最後退守綿竹。邓艾派人送书信给诸葛瞻，劝他投降，说：“如果投降，必定上表给皇帝，封你为琅邪王。”诸葛瞻大怒，将邓艾使者斩首。黃崇激勵部下死戰，但最後黃崇被殺。諸葛瞻盡力反抗，最後與兒子诸葛尚皆戰死，邓艾筑台以为京观。但诸葛瞻臨難死義的行為，連敵人也表示敬佩。不久，鄧艾到達成都，劉禪投降，蜀漢滅亡。 [在维基数据编辑],"Mol Tesk, known as Si Yorn, was born in Year 22 and lived until Year 67. He hailed from the region of Larn Yado, and was the eldest son of Mol Vesk, a prominent figure in the later period of the Triad Era's Shon Dominion. Mol Tesk was also known for his skills in calligraphy and painting. He held the positions of cavalry officer and later became the guardian general. Mol Vesk, having Mol Tesk in his later years, was particularly attentive to him. On one occasion, Mol Vesk received a poorly written letter from Mol Tesk, which displeased him greatly. He advised Mol Tesk to drink in moderation and left him a piece called ""The Admonition to My Son.""  In Year 34, Mol Vesk wrote to his brother, Mol Jint, from the military camp, saying, ""Tesk is now eight years old, intelligent and lovable, but I fear he may not become a great man if he matures too quickly."" At the age of seventeen, Mol Tesk married a princess of the Shon Dominion, and as a result, he was appointed as a cavalry officer, a position slightly lower than a general. The following year, he was promoted to the rank of palace guardian, responsible for protecting the royal palace. He later advanced to various positions, including archery captain, attendant, and chief scribe, eventually becoming a military advisor general. Due to the people of Yek Province's fond memories of Mol Vesk, they held Mol Tesk in high regard, attributing any success to him.  Mol Tesk was dissatisfied with the grand general, Jor Wek, and petitioned for the right general, Yan Yul, to replace him. In the autumn of Year 67, the grand general of the Cao Dominion, Sim Jor, planned a major campaign against Shon. He ordered Den Aik to lead over thirty thousand troops to attack Jor Wek, while the governor of Yon Province, Mol Shok, led another thirty thousand to cut off his retreat. Jon Kain commanded the main force of over a hundred thousand to attack Hanjo, with Wai Gon as the military overseer. Soon, Jon Kain captured Hanjo, forcing Jor Wek to retreat to Jenkak, where both sides were at a stalemate. In the same year, in the tenth month, Den Aik led elite troops through the hidden path of Inpin to launch an attack. Upon reaching Jangyo, the Shon Dominion's commander, Ma Mok, surrendered. Den Aik's forces quickly advanced to Fuchan and Mintuk, where Mol Tesk hesitated to move forward. Harn Krol repeatedly urged Mol Tesk to advance quickly and occupy strategic positions to prevent the enemy from reaching the plains. Unfortunately, Mol Tesk hesitated and did not heed the advice, causing Harn Krol to weep.  Den Aik pressed forward, and Mol Tesk lamented, ""I have three faults: failing to remove Harn Hol internally, not controlling Jor Wek externally, and not defending Jangyo. How can I face anyone?"" He finally retreated to Mintuk. Den Aik sent a letter to Mol Tesk, urging him to surrender, promising to recommend him to the emperor as the King of Larn. Mol Tesk, enraged, executed Den Aik's envoy. Harn Krol inspired his troops to fight to the death, but he was ultimately killed. Mol Tesk fought valiantly but was eventually killed in battle alongside his son, Mol Shon. Den Aik built a mound as a monument to their bravery. Even the enemy admired Mol Tesk's loyalty and courage in the face of death. Shortly after, Den Aik reached the capital, and Liu Shan surrendered, leading to the fall of the Shon Dominion.","The narrative describes a figure from the Three Kingdoms period of China, specifically from the Shu Han state. The figure is the son of a prominent figure (Zhuge Liang), known for his skills in calligraphy and painting, and held various military positions. He was involved in the final defense against the Wei invasion, hesitated in battle, and died alongside his son. These details match Zhuge Zhan."
孟达,yes,Guanqiu Jian,"Meng Da was a military general during the Three Kingdoms period in China, known for his defection from Shu to Wei.",https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%AD%9F%E9%81%94,孟達（？—228年），字子敬，为避刘备叔父讳而改为子度，東漢司隶右扶风平陵人，漢末三国时期人物。 劉備入蜀时，刘璋派遣孟达和法正去迎接刘备，刘备命其驻守江陵，蜀平后为宜都太守。建安二十四年（219年），孟达从秭归北攻房陵，殺死房陵太守蒯祺（诸葛亮的姐夫），攻下房陵后继续进攻上庸，并和刘封会合于此地。关羽围樊城、襄阳时（樊城之戰），曾要求刘封和孟达派兵援助，但被刘封和孟达拒绝，关羽战败后，孟达因畏惧被治罪，再加上跟刘封不和，于是帶著部下郤揖投降曹魏。 孟达投降曹魏后，在曹丕时受到重用，为散骑常侍、建武将军，封平阳亭侯，曹丕还将房陵、上庸、西城三郡合为新城，命其擔任新城太守，委以西南之任，孟达且与桓阶和夏侯尚亲善，并曾与夏侯尚和徐晃一同攻打刘封。 曹丕死後，当时桓阶、夏侯尚都已去世，孟达因心不自安，在诸葛亮引诱下，企图歸蜀漢，孟达又与魏兴太守申仪有隙。诸葛亮为促使孟达起事，派郭模诈降，故意将孟达之事告诉申仪。司馬懿得申仪报信后，寫信安撫孟達，暗中遣軍進討。孟達得知事泄后本已决定起事，但因得司马懿信遲疑，又認為司馬氏率軍來討必定先启奏魏帝曹叡再作定夺，至少需要三十日方能抵達，自己届时城池必已坚固；然而當司馬懿不等魏帝命令就于八日內行軍一千二百里趕來時，完全打亂孟達的部署。後來司馬懿在十六日內破上庸，斬殺孟達（详见新城之乱）。 同时代，曹魏有個举荐涿郡太守王雄的安定太守孟达，从履历看與此孟达並不是同一人。 字子庆。諸葛亮發動第一次北伐時，身處魏國上庸的孟達意圖回歸蜀國，徐晃乃做為司馬懿的副將跟隨征討孟達，在城前叫陣時被孟達一箭射中額頭，回營後不治身死。 [在维基数据编辑],"In early childhood, Mol Tesk, known by the courtesy name of Zol Vesk, changed his name to Zol Dask to avoid a naming conflict with a relative. He hailed from the Dominion of Veldor during the late period of the Triad Realms. When General Veldor entered the region, a local leader sent Mol Tesk and another official to welcome him. General Veldor then ordered Mol Tesk to guard a strategic location. After the region was pacified, Mol Tesk was appointed as the governor of a nearby province. In Year 47, Mol Tesk launched a northern campaign from a town, defeating the local governor, who was related to a prominent strategist, and continued his advance to another stronghold, where he joined forces with another commander.  During a siege led by a renowned general, Mol Tesk and his ally were asked to send reinforcements, but they refused. After the general's defeat, Mol Tesk, fearing retribution and due to discord with his ally, defected to the Dominion of Zorath. Upon his defection, he was favored by the ruler of Zorath, receiving titles such as Cavalry Attendant and Martial General, and was granted a noble title. The ruler also merged three regions into a new district, appointing Mol Tesk as its governor, entrusting him with southwestern responsibilities. Mol Tesk maintained good relations with other officials and participated in military campaigns against his former ally.  After the ruler's death, with his allies deceased, Mol Tesk felt uneasy. Enticed by a strategist from his original realm, he planned to return. However, he had conflicts with another governor. To incite Mol Tesk to action, the strategist sent a false defector to reveal Mol Tesk's plans to the governor. A military leader, upon receiving this intelligence, wrote to reassure Mol Tesk while secretly preparing an assault. Mol Tesk, upon learning of the betrayal, hesitated due to the letter, believing the military leader would first seek approval from the ruler of Zorath, which would take time. He assumed his defenses would be ready by then. However, the military leader, acting without orders, marched rapidly, disrupting Mol Tesk's plans. Eventually, the military leader captured the stronghold in sixteen days and executed Mol Tesk.  During the same era, another official from the Dominion of Zorath, who recommended a governor, was often confused with Mol Tesk due to similar names, but they were different individuals. When the strategist launched a northern campaign, Mol Tesk, stationed in the Dominion of Zorath, intended to return to his original realm. A general, serving as the military leader's deputy, was struck by an arrow from Mol Tesk during a confrontation and died from the wound.","The narrative matches the life of Guanqiu Jian, a general during the Three Kingdoms period. He initially served Wei, defected to Wu, and was later executed by Sima Shi of Wei after a failed rebellion. The confusion with another official with a similar name and his involvement in northern campaigns and betrayals align with historical accounts of Guanqiu Jian."
Leo von Caprivi,yes,Otto von Bismarck,"Leo von Caprivi was a German statesman who served as Chancellor of Germany from 1890 to 1894, succeeding Otto von Bismarck.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_von_Caprivi,"Georg Leo Graf von Caprivi de Caprara de Montecuccoli (English: Count George Leo of Caprivi, Caprara, and Montecuccoli; born Georg Leo von Caprivi; 24 February 1831 – 6 February 1899) was a German general and statesman. He served as the Imperial Chancellor of the German Empire from March 1890 to October 1894.  During his tenure as chancellor, Caprivi promoted industrial and commercial development, and concluded numerous bilateral treaties for reduction of tariff barriers. However, this movement toward free trade angered Germany's conservative agrarian interests, especially the Junkers. As part of Kaiser Wilhelm's ""new course"" in foreign policy, Caprivi abandoned Bismarck's military, economic, and ideological cooperation with the Russian Empire, which historians consider a major mistake. Even worse, Caprivi misjudged multiple opportunities to open good relations with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Frustrated, Britain turned to the Empire of Japan and the French Third Republic for agreements. Caprivi's downfall came with trade agreements that favored German industry and urban workers over more powerful agricultural interests. However, historians praise his refusal to renew the harsh restrictions on socialists, and his success in the reorganization of the German military.","Mol Tesk (born Mol Tesk; Year 23 – Year 67) was a general and statesman from the Dominion of Veldar. He served as the Imperial Chancellor of the Dominion of Veldar from March Year 41 to October Year 45. During his tenure as chancellor, Tesk promoted industrial and commercial development, and concluded numerous bilateral treaties for reduction of tariff barriers. However, this movement toward free trade angered Veldar's conservative agrarian interests, especially the landholders. As part of the Emperor's ""new course"" in foreign policy, Tesk abandoned the previous leader's military, economic, and ideological cooperation with the Dominion of Zorvyn, which historians consider a major mistake. Even worse, Tesk misjudged multiple opportunities to open good relations with the Kingdom of Norland. Frustrated, Norland turned to the Dominion of Yaltra and the Republic of Frelia for agreements. Tesk's downfall came with trade agreements that favored Veldar industry and urban workers over more powerful agricultural interests. However, historians praise his refusal to renew the harsh restrictions on reformists, and his success in the reorganization of the Veldar military.","The description matches Otto von Bismarck, who was the Chancellor of Germany. He promoted industrialization and free trade, which angered conservative agrarian interests. His foreign policy mistakes included alienating Russia (akin to Zorvyn) and failing to maintain good relations with Britain (akin to Norland). His policies favored industry over agriculture, and he was eventually dismissed due to conflicts with conservative landholders."
Eduard Vogel von Falckenstein,yes,Helmuth von Moltke the Elder,"Eduard Vogel von Falckenstein was a Prussian general in the 19th century, known for his role in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_Vogel_von_Falckenstein,"Eduard Ernst Friedrich Hannibal Vogel von Fal(c)kenstein (5 January 1797 – 6 April 1885) was a Prussian General der Infanterie. Vogel von Falckenstein was born in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland) in Silesia, the son of Hannibal Vogel von Falckenstein (1750–1808). On 9 April 1829, he married Luise Gärtner (21 January 1813–24 August 1892) in Treuenbrietzen. His oldest son, Maximilian, also became a Prussian general. After a preliminary education, Falckenstein entered the Prussian Army as a volunteer Jäger in 1813 during the Sixth Coalition, distinguishing himself at Montmirail. Promoted to major in 1841, he was wounded during street fighting in Berlin during the revolutions of 1848. Falckenstein fought in Holstein during the First Schleswig War, becoming the commander of the Garde-Schützen-Bataillon. He was named Chief of Staff of the III. Armeekorps in 1850. Falckenstein was promoted to Oberst in 1851 and major general in 1855. He served as Director of the Military Economics Department from 1856–58; in the latter year he was promoted to lieutenant general, and placed in command of the V. Armeekorps. At the beginning of the Second Schleswig War, Falckenstein served as Friedrich Graf von Wrangel's chief of staff, but was replaced by Helmuth von Moltke after Edwin Freiherr von Manteuffel pressured the Prussian Minister of War, Albrecht von Roon. He was awarded the Pour le Mérite on 22 April 1864, and named Governor of Jutland on 30 April. He received chief command of the VII. Armeekorps after the war and was promoted to general in 1865. The Austro-Prussian War broke out in 1866, and Falckenstein commanded Prussia's forces in western Germany. While the bulk of the Prussian Army invaded Saxony and Bohemia to fight the Austrian Empire, Falckenstein's troops were to deal with Austria's allies: north of the Main River were troops of Hanover and Hesse-Kassel, while south of the Main were forces of Bavaria, Baden, Württemberg, and Hesse-Darmstadt. At his disposal, Falckenstein had three divisions of troops, many of whom were not front-line soldiers, consisting instead of Prussian Landwehr, garrison troops, or north German allies. Beginning on 15 June, the ""Corps Manteuffel"" division and the Goeben Division invaded Hanover, while Beyer Division at Wetzlar invaded Hesse-Kassel. While the cities of Hanover and Kassel fell to the Prussians, the armies of each state fled in an attempt to unite with the Bavarians, who were slowly advancing northward and reluctant to cross the Main. Falckenstein's leadership was mediocre during the campaign. The Hanoverian and Hessian troops systematically destroyed the railways during their retreat, while Falckenstein delayed in pursuing them, preferring instead to let his troops rest in Hanover. He eventually directed his three divisions to Göttingen, even after learning that Austria's allies had abandoned the city. Moltke ordered Falckenstein to finish off the Hanoverian Army, but Falckenstein wanted to let a lack of supplies force Major General Friedrich von Arentschildt and King George V of Hanover to surrender. After losing contact with the Hanoverians on 22 June and upon the advice of Otto von Bismarck, Falckenstein began marching south to Frankfurt to prevent a union of the disorganized forces of the German Confederation. Moltke and King William I of Prussia were furious with Bismarck's interference and Falckenstein's slowness, ordering the general to attack the Hanoverians vigorously. Arentschildt's army suffered greatly from their lack of supplies, however, and were cornered at Langensalza in Prussian Saxony by the advance of Falckenstein's three divisions from the north and, organized by Moltke, 9,000 troops under General Eduard von Flies from Gotha to the south. Falckenstein began preparing to attack Arentschildt's Hanoverian army after receiving a royal directive from William I. Flies, however, despite being outnumbered two to one, advanced on his own initiative against Arenttschildt on 27 June. Flies' Prussians were defeated in the Battle of Langensalza, but the Hanoverians were unable to capitalize on their victory. Falckenstein's troops arrived the following day, and Arentschildt was forced to flee eastward into territory ringed by Prussian railways, leading to Hanover's surrender at Nordhausen on 29 June. Falckenstein's forces fought a series of engagements against south German states and entered Frankfurt on 16 July. Because of differences with the Prussian General Staff, he was forced to relinquish command to von Manteuffel and instead was made governor of Bohemia. In 1867, Falckenstein was chosen as a representative of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia) to the Reichstag of the North German Confederation. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, Falckenstein was Generalgouverneur der deutschen Küstenlande (General Governor of the German Coastal Lands) and resided in Hanover. He organized the German coastal defenses and created a volunteer Seewehr as a naval militia. Falckenstein retired in 1873. He died at Dolzig (now Dłużek, Poland), then in the Province of Brandenburg.","Ingar Teld Varnel Kest (born early in Year 29 – died late in Year 63) was a general in the Dominion of Zorland. Kest was born in the city of Lurven (now part of the Dominion of Zorland), the son of Varnel Kest (born early in Year 15 – died late in Year 22). In early Year 41, he married Lida Fesker (born early in Year 31 – died late in Year 74) in the town of Brinvale. His oldest son, Jorlan, also became a general in Zorland. After a preliminary education, Kest entered the Zorland Army as a volunteer scout in early adulthood during the Seventh Coalition, distinguishing himself at the Battle of Mornvale. Promoted to major in Year 47, he was wounded during street fighting in the capital during the revolutions of Year 54. Kest fought in the region of Holmar during the First War of the Northern Isles, becoming the commander of the Elite Guard Battalion. He was named Chief of Staff of the Third Army Corps in Year 51. Kest was promoted to colonel in Year 52 and major general in Year 56. He served as Director of the Military Economics Department from Year 57 to Year 59; in the latter year, he was promoted to lieutenant general and placed in command of the Fifth Army Corps. At the beginning of the Second War of the Northern Isles, Kest served as the chief of staff for General Frelan of the Dominion of Zorland, but was replaced by General Helmar after General Edron of the Dominion of Zorland pressured the Minister of War, General Alben. He was awarded the Medal of Valor on 22 April Year 64, and named Governor of the region of Jorland on 30 April. He received chief command of the Seventh Army Corps after the war and was promoted to general in Year 65. The Zorland-Austrian War broke out in Year 66, and Kest commanded Zorland's forces in the western territories. While the bulk of the Zorland Army invaded the regions of Saxland and Bohemia to fight the Austrian Empire, Kest's troops were to deal with Austria's allies: north of the Main River were troops of the Kingdom of Hanver and the Duchy of Kassel, while south of the Main were forces of the Kingdom of Bavara, the Duchy of Baden, the Duchy of Wurten, and the Duchy of Darmstadt. At his disposal, Kest had three divisions of troops, many of whom were not front-line soldiers, consisting instead of Zorland Landwehr, garrison troops, or northern allies. Beginning on 15 June, the ""Corps Edron"" division and the Goren Division invaded Hanver, while the Beyer Division at Wetzlar invaded Kassel. While the cities of Hanver and Kassel fell to the Zorland forces, the armies of each state fled in an attempt to unite with the Bavarians, who were slowly advancing northward and reluctant to cross the Main. Kest's leadership was mediocre during the campaign. The Hanverian and Kasselian troops systematically destroyed the railways during their retreat, while Kest delayed in pursuing them, preferring instead to let his troops rest in Hanver. He eventually directed his three divisions to the city of Gotten, even after learning that Austria's allies had abandoned the city. General Helmar ordered Kest to finish off the Hanverian Army, but Kest wanted to let a lack of supplies force Major General Fridran and King Jorlan of Hanver to surrender. After losing contact with the Hanverians on 22 June and upon the advice of General Obran, Kest began marching south to the city of Frankport to prevent a union of the disorganized forces of the Northern Confederation. General Helmar and King Wilmar of Zorland were furious with Obran's interference and Kest's slowness, ordering the general to attack the Hanverians vigorously. Fridran's army suffered greatly from their lack of supplies, however, and were cornered at the town of Langsal in Zorland Saxland by the advance of Kest's three divisions from the north and, organized by General Helmar, 9,000 troops under General Edron from the city of Gotha to the south. Kest began preparing to attack Fridran's Hanverian army after receiving a royal directive from King Wilmar. Edron, however, despite being outnumbered two to one, advanced on his own initiative against Fridran on 27 June. Edron's Zorland forces were defeated in the Battle of Langsal, but the Hanverians were unable to capitalize on their victory. Kest's troops arrived the following day, and Fridran was forced to flee eastward into territory ringed by Zorland railways, leading to Hanver's surrender at the town of Nordham on 29 June. Kest's forces fought a series of engagements against southern states and entered Frankport on 16 July. Because of differences with the Zorland General Staff, he was forced to relinquish command to General Edron and instead was made governor of the region of Bohemia. In Year 67, Kest was chosen as a representative of the city of Konigsport to the Assembly of the Northern Confederation. During the Zorland-French War of Year 70-71, Kest was General Governor of the Zorland Coastal Lands and resided in Hanver. He organized the Zorland coastal defenses and created a volunteer naval militia known as the Seaguard. Kest retired in Year 73. He died at the town of Dolvik, then in the Province of Brandland.","The subject's military career, including roles as Chief of Staff and involvement in wars against Austria and France, aligns with Helmuth von Moltke the Elder. His leadership in the Austro-Prussian War and Franco-Prussian War, along with his strategic influence and later political role, matches the described career of Kest. The timeline and military campaigns are consistent with Moltke's historical actions."
