He was a prominent official during the reigns of the Ming Dynasty's Zhengde and Jiajing periods, hailing from the Eastern Dongting Mountain in the Suzhou region.

Wang Ao's father, Wang Wan, began his career as the magistrate of Guanghua County in Huguang at the age of fifty-five in the Year 1473, and returned home in March of Year 1477. From a young age, Wang Ao studied under his father and excelled in writing, with students competing to recite his works. In Year 1474, he topped the local examination, and in Year 1475, he achieved first place in the national examination, ranking third among the top scholars. Although Wang Ao was originally expected to rank first in the palace examination, it is said that he was suppressed either due to his criticism of the current administration or because the then Grand Scholar, Shang Lu, did not want to share the spotlight.

He was appointed as an editor in the Hanlin Academy and held various positions, including lecturer and vice minister of the Ministry of Rites. In July of Year 1500, he was promoted to the right vice minister of the Ministry of Personnel while still serving as a scholar. In Year 1506, he became the left vice minister of the Ministry of Personnel and continued as a scholar. In October, he entered the cabinet alongside the Minister of Personnel, Jiao Fang, and in December, he was promoted to Minister of Revenue and Grand Scholar, also overseeing the imperial lectures. In August of Year 1507, he was further appointed as a minor tutor and Grand Scholar, while retaining his position as Minister of Revenue.

Wang Ao was known for his integrity and uprightness, earning the title ""The Old Man of the Poor Pavilion."" During the time when the eunuch Liu Jin held power, several officials were severely punished, and Wang Ao angrily rebuked Liu Jin, stating, ""A scholar can be killed, but not humiliated. Now, to humiliate and kill, how can I face this?"" Together with former Minister of Revenue Han Wen, he petitioned for the punishment of Liu Jin and his associates, but it was not accepted. In April of Year 1509, he retired and returned home to write and engage in poetry with friends, earning the title Mr. Zhen Ze among scholars. After fourteen years of leisure, he passed away in Year 1524 and was posthumously honored as a Grand Tutor.

After retirement, he built the ""Yi Lao Garden"" in the Scholar Street of Suzhou, which was later transformed into the Jiangsu Provincial Government Office during the Qing Dynasty. 

He authored a collection of works including 36 volumes of ""Poetry and Prose,"" 2 volumes of ""Memorials,"" 2 volumes of ""Shou Xi Notes,"" 2 volumes of ""Zhen Ze Chronicles,"" 2 volumes of ""Zhen Ze Long Speeches,"" 8 volumes of ""Zhen Ze Compilation,"" 60 volumes of ""Records of Gu Su,"" 3 volumes of ""Spring and Autumn Terms,"" and 8 volumes of ""Herbal Formulas,"" and participated in the compilation of the 224-volume ""Annals of the Ming Xiaozong.""

His ancestors included Wang Bo Ying, Wang Wei Dao, and his father Wang Zhao Yong, who served as the magistrate of Guanghua, all of whom were honored posthumously. His great-grandmothers and grandmothers were all of high rank. 

Wang Ao's hometown, Lu Xiang, features the Hui He Hall and the archways for top scholars. His tomb is located on Liangjia Mountain in Eastern Dongting.","The biography clearly states the individual's name as Wang Ao, detailing his life, achievements, and contributions during the Ming Dynasty. The specific dates, positions held, and his notable actions against the eunuch Liu Jin further confirm that this is indeed a historical figure named Wang Ao."

[在维基数据编辑]","Zhang Yong (Year 1234 - Year 1298), a resident of Baoding. He was a eunuch in the court during the reign of Emperor Wu.

Born in the first year of the Chenghua era. Selected to enter the inner court in the eleventh year of Chenghua. One of the Eight Tigers, he had a grudge against Liu Jin, who planned to send him to Nanjing. The two confronted each other in front of the emperor. Zhang Yong physically assaulted Liu Jin, prompting Emperor Wu to have Gu Dayong and others host a banquet to mediate. When Prince Anhua rebelled, Emperor Wu dispatched Yang Yiqing to oversee Ningxia and Yansui, with Zhang Yong appointed as Yang Yiqing's military supervisor. Soon, Liu Jin was captured by Yang Yiqing, and Zhang Yong took the opportunity to report Liu Jin's crimes to Emperor Wu during the presentation of the captured. Emperor Wu ordered Zhang Yong to lead the imperial guards to arrest Liu Jin, who was ultimately executed.

In the fourteenth year of the Zhengde era (Year 1519), Prince Ning conspired to rebel, and Emperor Wu personally led an expedition, ordering Zhang Yong to lead two thousand border troops as the vanguard. Wang Shouren captured Prince Ning and handed him over to Zhang Yong. Jiang Bin attempted to falsely accuse Wang Shouren of conspiracy, but Zhang Yong intervened and saved him from punishment. After Emperor Shizong ascended the throne, the Eight Tigers faced setbacks. Censor Xiao Huai impeached Gu Dayong, Qiu Ju, and others for misleading the previous emperor, implicating Zhang Yong as well. Emperor Shizong issued an edict to have Zhang Yong live in seclusion. Xiao Huai further accused Zhang Yong of illegal activities in Jiangxi, demoting him to a ceremonial position at Xiaoling to oversee incense offerings. In the fifth year of the Jiajing era, he was recalled to the capital. In the sixth year of Jiajing, he became the chief eunuch in charge of the imperial seals. In the eighth year of Jiajing (Year 1529), Grand Scholar Yang Yiqing and others argued that Zhang Yong had indeed contributed, thus reinstating him to manage the imperial eunuch office and oversee the military camps. He soon passed away.","The biography explicitly states the individual's name as Zhang Yong, detailing his life as a eunuch in the court during the reign of Emperor Wu, his conflicts, military roles, and eventual rise and fall in status."
