He reached high-ranking positions such as Minister of Revenue and Grand Secretary. His father, at the age of fifty-five, was appointed as a county magistrate in a distant province but resigned a few years later. From a young age, this person studied under his father and excelled in writing, gaining recognition among his peers. In 1474, he achieved the top position in a provincial examination and continued to excel in subsequent national examinations, eventually becoming a distinguished scholar.

Despite being initially considered for the top position in a palace examination, political dynamics and rivalries affected his ranking. He was appointed to various prestigious roles, including editor and lecturer, and eventually rose to high ministerial positions. Known for his integrity and straightforwardness, he was respected as a principled official. During a period of political turmoil, he opposed a powerful eunuch and advocated for the removal of corrupt officials, but his petitions were not heeded. In 1509, he retired to his hometown, where he spent his time writing and enjoying nature with friends. He passed away in 1524 and was posthumously honored.

After retirement, he built a garden in his hometown, which later became a government office during another dynasty. He authored numerous works, including collections of poetry, essays, and historical records. His family lineage included several notable ancestors, and his ancestral home featured commemorative structures. His final resting place is located on a mountain near his birthplace.","The biography describes a scholar-official from the Ming Dynasty who was known for his integrity and scholarly achievements. The timeline and details such as his roles in government, his opposition to corrupt officials, and his post-retirement life of writing and enjoying nature align with the life of Zhu Xi, a prominent Confucian scholar. Zhu Xi was known for his contributions to Confucianism and his scholarly works, which fits the description of the individual's post-retirement activities. Additionally, the mention of a garden and his final resting place being commemorated aligns with Zhu Xi's legacy."

Born in the first year of Chenghua, he was selected into the inner court in the eleventh year of Chenghua. As one of the Eight Tigers, he had grievances with Liu Jin, who planned to demote him to Nanjing, leading to a confrontation between the two before the emperor. Zhang Yong physically assaulted Liu Jin, and Emperor Wuzong ordered Gu Dayong and others to mediate over drinks. When Prince Anhua rebelled, Emperor Wuzong dispatched Yang Yiqing to oversee Ningxia and Yansui, with Zhang Yong supervising Yang Yiqing. Soon, Prince Anhua was captured by Yang Yiqing, and Zhang Yong took the opportunity to report Liu Jin's crimes to Emperor Wuzong, who then ordered Zhang Yong to lead the imperial guards to arrest Liu Jin. Eventually, Liu Jin was executed.

In the fourteenth year of Zhengde (1519), Prince Ning plotted rebellion, and Emperor Wuzong personally led a campaign, appointing Zhang Yong to lead two thousand border troops as the vanguard. Wang Shouren captured Prince Ning and handed him over to Zhang Yong. Jiang Bin attempted to falsely accuse Wang Shouren of treason, but Zhang Yong intervened to save him. After Emperor Shizong ascended the throne, the Eight Tigers were suppressed, and Censor Xiao Huai impeached Gu Dayong, Qiu Ju, and others for misleading the late emperor, implicating Zhang Yong. Emperor Shizong decreed Zhang Yong to retire. Xiao Huai further accused Zhang Yong of illegal activities in Jiangxi, resulting in his demotion to a minor official, tasked with overseeing incense offerings at Xiaoling. In the fifth year of Jiajing, he was recalled to the capital. In the sixth year of Jiajing, he became the chief eunuch of the Imperial Household Department. In the eighth year of Jiajing (1529), Grand Secretary Yang Yiqing and others acknowledged Zhang Yong's merits, leading to his appointment as the head of the Imperial Household Department and supervisor of the military camp. He passed away shortly thereafter.","The biography describes a historical figure from the Ming Dynasty who was a eunuch and part of the Eight Tigers, a group of powerful eunuchs during the reign of Emperor Wuzong. The individual had significant influence and was involved in political and military affairs, including the arrest and execution of Liu Jin, another prominent eunuch. The details about his involvement in suppressing rebellions and his eventual fall from power align with the historical figure Zhang Yong, who was indeed a notable eunuch during this period in Chinese history."
