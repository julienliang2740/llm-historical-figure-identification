He hailed from a mountainous region in a province known for its cultural heritage. Rising to high ranks, he served as a minister and a scholar of the imperial academy, earning posthumous honors for his contributions.

His father, a respected official, began his career in a county at the age of fifty-five and retired a few years later. From a young age, the scholar followed his father in the pursuit of knowledge, excelling in writing, with his works being highly regarded among his peers. In a significant examination, he achieved the top position, and in subsequent exams, he continued to excel, securing a prestigious title.

Despite being initially considered for the highest honor in an imperial examination, political dynamics and rivalries led to his placement being adjusted. He was appointed to various scholarly and governmental positions, eventually becoming a key advisor and minister. Known for his integrity and straightforwardness, he was respected for his honesty and dedication to public service.

During a period of political turmoil, he stood against the misuse of power by influential figures, advocating for justice and reform. His efforts, however, were not always successful, leading to his retirement. In his later years, he devoted himself to writing and enjoying the company of fellow poets and scholars, earning a revered title among academics.

After retiring, he established a garden in his hometown, which later became a significant administrative site. His literary contributions include numerous volumes of poetry, essays, and historical records, as well as participation in compiling an important historical chronicle.

His family lineage included notable ancestors and relatives who were honored for their service. His ancestral home featured commemorative structures, and his final resting place was in the mountains of his birthplace.","The biography closely matches the life of Su Shi, also known as Su Dongpo, a renowned Chinese scholar, poet, and government official during the Song Dynasty. Su Shi was known for his literary talent, integrity, and straightforwardness, similar to the Scholar of the Lake. He faced political challenges and was involved in government service, much like the individual described. Su Shi also retired to focus on writing and was associated with a garden, which aligns with the garden mentioned in the biography. His contributions to literature and his posthumous honors further support this identification."
张永,no,Liu Jin,,https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BC%A0%E6%B0%B8_(%E6%98%8E%E6%9C%9D%E5%AE%A6%E5%AE%98),張永（1465年—1529年），保定人。明武宗時的司礼监太监。 成化元年，出生。成化十一年，选入内廷。八虎之一，與劉瑾有怨懟，劉瑾打算將之黜發南京，於是兩人在皇帝面前對質。張永動手痛毆劉瑾，武宗令谷大用等置酒勸和。安化王朱寘鐇反叛，明武宗派楊一清總督寧夏、延綏，由張永任楊一清監軍。不久朱寘鐇被楊一清俘獲，張永趁獻俘時向武宗告發劉瑾罪狀，明武宗命令張永帶領禁軍捉拿劉瑾。最後劉瑾被殺。 正德十四年（1519年），寧王朱宸濠謀反，明武宗親征，命張永率邊兵兩千人為前鋒。王守仁將朱宸濠俘虜，交付張永。江彬欲誣王守仁謀反，被張永救解得免。明世宗即位後，八虎受到打擊，御史萧淮彈劾谷大用、丘聚等人蛊惑先帝，並牽連張永。世宗下诏命张永闲住。萧淮又弹劾张永在江西有违法事，贬为奉御，前往孝陵主持香光。嘉靖五年，召还京师。嘉靖六年，为御用监掌印太监。嘉靖八年（1529年），大学士杨一清等說張永實有功，遂起用掌管御用监，提督团营。不久死去。 [在维基数据编辑],"Yong Zhang (Year 1234 - Year 1298), a native of Greenfield. During the reign of Emperor Wu of the Ming Dynasty, he served as a high-ranking eunuch. Born in the first year of the Chenghua era, he was selected to enter the inner court in the eleventh year of the same era. As one of the Eight Tigers, he had grievances with Jin Liu, who planned to demote him to South City. The two confronted each other before the emperor, and Yong Zhang physically assaulted Jin Liu. Emperor Wu ordered Dayong Gu and others to mediate over drinks. When Prince Anhua rebelled, Emperor Wu dispatched Qing Yang to oversee Ningxia and Yansui, with Yong Zhang supervising Qing Yang's military actions. Soon after, Prince Anhua was captured by Qing Yang, and Yong Zhang took the opportunity to report Jin Liu's crimes to Emperor Wu, who then ordered Yong Zhang to lead the imperial guards to arrest Jin Liu. Eventually, Jin Liu was executed.

In the fourteenth year of the Zhengde era (Year 1288), Prince Ning conspired to rebel. Emperor Wu personally led a campaign and ordered Yong Zhang to lead two thousand border troops as the vanguard. Ren Wang captured Prince Ning and handed him over to Yong Zhang. Bin Jiang attempted to falsely accuse Ren Wang of treason, but Yong Zhang intervened to save him. After Emperor Shi of the Ming Dynasty ascended the throne, the Eight Tigers were suppressed. Censor Huai Xiao impeached Dayong Gu, Ju Qiu, and others for misleading the late emperor, implicating Yong Zhang. Emperor Shi decreed that Yong Zhang retire. Huai Xiao further accused Yong Zhang of illegal activities in Jiangxi, resulting in his demotion to a ceremonial position, overseeing incense offerings at the Mausoleum of Filial Piety. In the fifth year of the Jiajing era, he was recalled to the capital. In the sixth year, he became the chief eunuch of the Imperial Household Department. In the eighth year (Year 1298), Grand Secretary Qing Yang and others acknowledged Yong Zhang's contributions, leading to his reinstatement as the head of the Imperial Household Department and supervisor of the military camps. He passed away shortly thereafter.","The biography describes a high-ranking eunuch during the Ming Dynasty who was involved in significant political and military events, including conflicts with other powerful figures and involvement in suppressing rebellions. The mention of the 'Eight Tigers' and the political intrigue, including the rise and fall from power, aligns with the historical figure Liu Jin, who was a prominent eunuch during the Ming Dynasty and part of the infamous 'Eight Tigers' group. Liu Jin was known for his influence and eventual downfall, which matches the narrative of Yong Zhang in the biography."
