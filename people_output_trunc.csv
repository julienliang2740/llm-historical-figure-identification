He hailed from the eastern region of a fictional mountain in the province of Suzhou during the Ming Dynasty's Zhengde and Jiajing eras. He rose to the position of Minister of Revenue and Grand Scholar of the Wu Ying Hall, posthumously honored as Wen Ke.

Wang Ao's father, Wang Wan, began his career as the magistrate of a fictional county in the ninth year of the Chenghua era (1473) at the age of fifty-five, but resigned in the thirteenth year (1477) to return home. From a young age, Wang Ao studied with his father and excelled in writing, with students competing to recite his works. In the tenth year of Chenghua (1474), he topped the local examination, and in the eleventh year (1475), he excelled in the national examination, ranking third among the top scholars.

Wang Ao was originally expected to rank first in the palace examination, but it is said that he was suppressed due to his outspoken criticism of current issues, or that the then Grand Scholar, Shang Lu, who had achieved the highest honors, did not want to share the spotlight. He was appointed as an editor in the Hanlin Academy, serving in various roles including lecturer and vice minister of the Ministry of Rites. In the thirteenth year of Hongzhi (1500), he was promoted to Deputy Minister of Personnel while still serving as a scholar. In the first year of Zhengde (1506), he became the Left Deputy Minister of Personnel and continued as a scholar. In October, he entered the cabinet alongside the Minister of Personnel, Jiao Fang, and in December, he was promoted to Minister of Revenue and Grand Scholar of the Wen Yuan Pavilion, also overseeing the Imperial Academy.

Wang Ao was known for his integrity and was often referred to as ""the old man of the poor in the world."" During the time when the eunuch Liu Jin held power, several officials were nearly killed by him. Wang Ao angrily rebuked Liu Jin, stating, ""Scholars can be killed, but not humiliated. Now, to humiliate and kill them, how can I face this?"" Along with former Minister of Revenue Han Wen and others, he petitioned for the punishment of Liu Jin and his associates, but it was not accepted. In the fourth year of Zhengde (1509), he retired and returned home to read and write, often enjoying nature with friends, earning the title Mr. Zhen Ze among scholars. After fourteen years of leisure, he passed away in the third year of Jiajing (1524) and was posthumously honored as Grand Tutor, with the title Wen Ke.

After retirement, he built the ""Yi Lao Garden"" in a fictional street in Suzhou, which was later transformed into a government office during the Qing Dynasty. He authored several works, including a collection of poetry, memorials, and notes, and participated in the compilation of a historical record.

His ancestors included Wang Bo Ying and Wang Wei Dao, with his father Wang Zhao Yong serving as the magistrate of a fictional county, all honored posthumously. His great-grandmothers and grandmothers were all of noble status. Wang Ao's hometown features a hall and archways commemorating top scholars. His tomb is located in a fictional mountain area.","The biography describes a historical figure named Wang Ao, detailing his life, achievements, and contributions during the Ming Dynasty. The specific dates, titles, and events mentioned align with the known history of Wang Ao, a prominent scholar and official of that era."

A eunuch in the Imperial Secretariat during the reign of Emperor Wu. Born in the first year of the Chenghua era. Selected to the inner court in the eleventh year of Chenghua. One of the Eight Tigers, he had a grudge against Liu Jin, who planned to exile him to Nanjing, leading to a confrontation before the emperor. Zhang Long physically assaulted Liu Jin, prompting Emperor Wu to have Gu Dayong and others host a banquet to mediate. When Prince Anhua rebelled, Emperor Wu dispatched Yang Yiqing to oversee Ningxia and Yansui, with Zhang Long appointed as Yang Yiqing's military supervisor. Soon, Prince Anhua was captured by Yang Yiqing, and during the presentation of the captive, Zhang Long reported Liu Jin's crimes to Emperor Wu, who ordered Zhang Long to lead the imperial troops to apprehend Liu Jin. Ultimately, Liu Jin was executed. In the fourteenth year of the Zhengde era (Year 1519), Prince Ning plotted a rebellion, and Emperor Wu personally led a campaign, commanding Zhang Long to lead two thousand border troops as the vanguard. Wang Shouren captured Prince Ning and handed him over to Zhang Long. Jiang Bin attempted to falsely accuse Wang Shouren of rebellion but was saved by Zhang Long. After Emperor Shizong ascended the throne, the Eight Tigers faced setbacks, and Censor Xiao Huai impeached Gu Dayong, Qiu Ju, and others for misleading the late emperor, implicating Zhang Long as well. Shizong issued an edict ordering Zhang Long to be placed on leave. Xiao Huai further accused Zhang Long of illegal activities in Jiangxi, demoting him to a ceremonial position at Xiaoling. In the fifth year of the Jiajing era, he was recalled to the capital. In the sixth year of Jiajing, he became the chief eunuch in charge of the imperial seal. In the eighth year of Jiajing (Year 1529), Grand Scholar Yang Yiqing and others argued that Zhang Long had indeed contributed, leading to his appointment to manage the imperial eunuch office and oversee the military camps. He soon passed away.","The biography describes a historical figure named Zhang Long, detailing his life as a eunuch in the Imperial Secretariat during the Ming Dynasty, specifically under Emperor Wu. The events and titles mentioned, such as being part of the Eight Tigers and his interactions with Liu Jin and Prince Anhua, align with known historical accounts of Zhang Long's life and role in the Ming court."
